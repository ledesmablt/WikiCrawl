The album was met with critical acclaim and fared well on music charts, peaking at number five on the US Billboard 200.\\n\\n\\n== Early life ==\\nD'Angelo was born Michael Eugene Archer, in Richmond, Virginia on February 11, 1974, to a Pentecostal preacher father. He was raised in an entirely Pentecostal family. Archer's musical talents were discovered very early on. At 3, he was spotted by his 10-year-old brother Luther, playing the house piano. Following the formation of his native-Richmond, Virginia musical group, Michael Archer and Precise, and its success on the Amateur Night competition at Harlem, New York's Apollo Theater in 1991, the 18-year-old singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist dropped out of school and moved to New York City, as an attempt to develop his music career. The group previously enjoyed some notice in Richmond, evenly dividing their repertoire between soul covers and originals, while D'Angelo accumulated compositions of his own and developed his songwriting skills. The group's turnout on Amateur Night resulted in three consecutive wins and cash prize, after which, upon returning home to Richmond, D'Angelo was inspired to produce an album and began composing material, after a brief tenure as a member of the hip hop group I.D.U. (Intelligent, Deadly but Unique).\\n\\n\\n== Career ==\\n\\n\\n=== 1991-1995: Brown Sugar ===\\nD'Angelo signed a publishing deal with EMI Music in 1991 after catching the attention of record executives through a demo tape, which was originally by the group. After an impressive audition for EMI execs, a three-hour impromptu piano recital, D'Angelo was signed to a recording contract in 1993. A&R-man Gary Harris was primarily responsible for his signing, while manager Kedar Massenburg helped negotiate the contract as well. Massenburg became D'Angelo's manager after hearing of him through \\\"the buzz on the streets\\\". He had previously managed hip hop group Stetsasonic and formed the artist management-firm Kedar Entertainment in 1991, which he diversified into production, music publishing and publicity.In 1994, his first significant success came in the form of the hit single \\\"U Will Know\\\". D'Angelo co-wrote and co-produced the song for the all-male R&B supergroup Black Men United, which featured R&B singers such as Brian McKnight, Usher, R. Kelly, Boyz II Men, Raphael Saadiq and Gerald Levert. D'Angelo composed the music for \\\"U Will Know\\\", while his brother, Luther Archer, wrote the lyrics. Originally featured on the soundtrack to the film Jason's Lyric (1994), the single peaked at number 5 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks and at number 28 on the Billboard Hot 100. The music video for \\\"U Will Know\\\" featured D'Angelo as the group's choir director; he reprised the role for the live performance of the song at the Soul Train Music Awards. That same year, he wrote and produced the song \\\"Overjoyed\\\" for the Boys Choir of Harlem, which appeared on their studio album The Sound of Hope (1994). The success of \\\"U Will Know\\\" helped build the buzz surrounding D'Angelo, which was followed by a number of highly promoted showcases, and added to the buzz among music industry insiders.Brown Sugar was released in June 1995. Although sales were sluggish at first, the album was eventually a hit. The album debuted at number six on the US Billboard Top R&B Albums chart in the week of July 22, 1995. It ultimately peaked at number four in the week of February 24, 1996, and spent a total of 54 weeks on the chart. Brown Sugar also spent 65 weeks on the Billboard 200 and peaked at number 22 on the chart. It sold 300,000 copies within its two months of release. The album had been selling 35,000 to 40,000 copies a week through to November 1995, and by January 1996, it had sold 400,000 copies. With the help of its four singles, including the gold-selling Billboard Hot 100 hit \\\"Lady\\\" and R&B top-ten singles \\\"Brown Sugar\\\" and \\\"Cruisin\\\", the album reached sales of 500,000 copies in the United States by October 1995. On February 7, 1996, it was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America, following shipments in excess of one million copies in the U.S. The album was certified gold in Canada on May 9, 2000. Its total sales have been estimated within the range of 1.5 million to over two million copies.\\n\\n\\n=== 1996-2000: Sabbatical period and Voodoo ===\\nFollowing the success of his debut album Brown Sugar (1995), D'Angelo went into a four and a half year absence from the music scene and releasing solo work. After spending two years on tour promoting Brown Sugar, D'Angelo found himself stuck with writer's block. On the setback, D'Angelo later stated \\\"The thing about writer's block is that you want to write so fucking bad, [but] the songs don't come out that way. They come from life. So you've got to live to write.\\\" During his sabbatical period, he generally released cover versions and remakes, including a cover-collaboration with Erykah Badu of the Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell duet song \\\"Your Precious Love\\\" for the soundtrack to High School High (1996). D'Angelo also covered Prince's \\\"She's Always in My Hair\\\" for the Scream 2 soundtrack (1997), as well as the Ohio Players' \\\"Heaven Must Be Like This\\\" for the Down in the Delta soundtrack (1998). He also appeared on a duet, \\\"Nothing Even Matters\\\", with Lauryn Hill for her debut solo album The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998). He also spent the time lifting weights, smoking weed, and making music.The much-delayed follow-up to Brown Sugar, Voodoo, was finally released in 2000 on Virgin Records after the EMI Records Group was absorbed by the former label. Voodoo received rave reviews from contemporary music critics. who dubbed it a \\\"masterpiece\\\" and D'Angelo's greatest work. The album debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 chart, selling 320,000 copies in its first week. It entered the Billboard 200 on February 12, 2000 and remained on the chart for 33 consecutive weeks. As of 2005, the album has sold over 1.7 million copies in the US, according to Nielsen SoundScan. In 2001, Voodoo won a Grammy Award for Best R&B Album at the 43rd Grammy Awards, which was awarded to D'Angelo and recording engineer Russell Elevado.Its first two singles, \\\"Devil's Pie\\\" and \\\"Left & Right\\\", peaked at number 69 and number 70 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The latter was commercially aimed at R&B and hip hop-oriented radio stations due to the prominence of rappers Redman and Method Man on the track. According to Rich Ford, Jr., producer of the \\\"Left & Right\\\" music video, both the single and the video went commercially unnoticed due to MTV's refusal to place the song's video in rotation, serving as punishment for missing the deadline for its initial premiere. The fifth single \\\"Feel Like Makin' Love\\\" was less successful, reaching number 109 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks. \\\"Send It On\\\", the album's fourth single, achieved moderate chart success, peaking at number 33 on Billboard's Pop Singles chart. The album's third single, \\\"Untitled (How Does It Feel)\\\", became its greatest chart success, peaking at number 25 on the Hot 100 Singles and at number two on the R&B Singles chart. Its infamous music video helped in boosting the song's appeal, as well as D'Angelo's. Billboard wrote of the video, \\\"It's pure sexuality. D'Angelo, muscularly cut and glistening, is shot from the hips up, naked, with just enough shown to prompt a slow burning desire in most any woman who sees it. The video alone could make the song one of the biggest of the coming year\\\". It earned three nominations for the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards, including Video of the Year, Best R&B Video, and Best Male Video.\\n\\n\\n=== 2001-2013: Second sabbatical, struggles and delayed album ===\\nTowards the end of his worldwide tour in support of the album that same year, D'Angelo's personal issues had worsened, affecting performances. He became more conscious of and uncomfortable with his status as a sex symbol, and after the tour D'Angelo returned to his home in Richmond, Virginia, disappearing from the public eye. Several of D'Angelo's peers and affiliates have noted the commercial impact of the \\\"Untitled (How Does It Feel)\\\" music video and The Voodoo Tour as contributing factors to D'Angelo's period of absence from the music scene. His former music manager, Dominique Trenier, explained his disappointment in the music video's impact in a 2008 interview for Spin magazine. Trenier was quoted as saying that \\\"to this day, in the general populace's memory, he's the naked dude\\\".According to tour manager Alan Leeds, the experience \\\"took away his confidence, because he's not convinced why any given fan is supporting him.\\\"\\nFollowing the suicide of his close friend, MTV-affiliate Fred Jordan, in April 2001, he started to develop a drinking problem. As his alcoholism escalated, plans for a live album and a Soultronics studio effort, both originally set for after the tour, were scrapped, and impatient Virgin executives cut off funding for the expected 2004 solo album.By 2005, D'Angelo's girlfriend had left him, his attorney had become displeased with him, and most of his family was not in touch with him. He also parted ways with manager Dominique Trenier and tour manager Alan Leeds. After a car accident and an arrest on DUI and marijuana possession charges, D'Angelo left Virgin Records in 2005 and checked into the Crossroads Centre rehabilitation clinic in Antigua. In 2005, his recording contract was acquired by J Records, following rumors of D'Angelo signing to Bad Boy Records. Despite no solo output, D'Angelo collaborated with some R&B and hip hop artists during this period between albums, appearing on albums such as J Dilla's The Shining (2006), Snoop Dogg's Tha Blue Carpet Treatment (2006), Common's Finding Forever (2007), and Q-Tip's The Renaissance (2008).D'Angelo's subsequent solo work was extensively delayed. Production for a full-length follow-up to Voodoo was stagnant, as he was working on and off mostly by himself during 2002. D'Angelo attempted to play every instrument for the project, striving for complete creative control similar to that of Prince. Russell Elevado described the resulting material as \\\"Parliament/Funkadelic meets the Beatles meets Prince, and the whole time there's this Jimi Hendrix energy\\\". However, those who previewed its songs found it to be unfinished. In the years that followed, D'Angelo's personal problems worsened, descending to drug and alcohol addiction. In January 2005 he was arrested and charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine. Various mugshots began circulating around the time, showing the singer looking overweight and unhealthy, in stark contrast to the muscular D'Angelo seen in promotion for Voodoo. In September 2005, a week after being sentenced on the drug charges, he was involved in a car accident, and was rumoured to be critically injured. However, a week after the crash a statement was issued by D'Angelo's attorney stating that he was fine continuing to say \\\"He is anxious to finish the recording of his soul masterpiece that the world has patiently awaited.\\n\\nNo more was revealed on the new album until 2007, when Questlove leaked an unfinished track on Triple J Radio in Australia. Entitled \\\"Really Love\\\", the track was an acoustic flavored jam with a laid back swing feel. The leak apparently soured relations between the two. D'Angelo released a CD/DVD compilation album entitled The Best So Far..., first released on June 24, 2008 on Virgin Records. The compilation features songs from his two previous studio albums, Brown Sugar and Voodoo, as well as rarities and a second disc, a DVD of previously unreleased videos. Around the same time, the compilation was released digitally without the Erykah Badu and Raphael Saddiq featured songs, under the title Ultimate D'Angelo.In late November 2011, D'Angelo announced a series of 2012 European tour dates. The tour kicked off January 26 in Stockholm, Sweden with its final show on February 10. The tour featured a selection of hits from his two previous albums and songs from his upcoming album, which was close to completion. He premiered 4 new songs: \\\"Sugah Daddy\\\", \\\"Ain't That Easy\\\", \\\"Another Life\\\" and \\\"The Charade\\\" which were well received. On June 9, 2012, he joined Questlove for the annual Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival's Superjam. Although he didn't play any of his original material, this marked the first time in nearly 12 years that he performed on stage in the US. On September 1, 2012, D'Angelo performed at Jay-Z's Made In America festival where he again performed the new songs, \\\"The Charade\\\" and \\\"Sugah Daddy\\\". On October 7, RCA Music Group announced that it was disbanding J Records, Arista Records, and Jive Records.  With the shutdown, D'Angelo (and all other artists previously signed to those labels) would release his future material on RCA Records.\\n\\n\\n=== 2014-present: Black Messiah ===\\nD'Angelo released his third studio album, Black Messiah in December 2014. D'Angelo originally wanted to release Black Messiah in 2015, but the controversial decisions in the Ferguson and Eric Garner cases inspired him to release it earlier. On December 12, 2014, Kevin Liles, D'Angelo's manager, shared a 15-second teaser of the album on YouTube. Two days later, the track \\\"Sugah Daddy\\\", which had been part of D'Angelo's set list since 2012, premiered at 3 am EST and 1,000 downloads were available on Red Bull's 20 Before 15 website. After an exclusive listening party in New York, Black Messiah was released digitally on December 15 through iTunes, Google Play Music, and Spotify. The album's unexpected release was compared to Beyonce's self-titled release in 2013. On January 13, 2015, \\\"Really Love\\\" was released to urban adult contemporary radio in the US.\\nThe album was met with universal acclaim from critics and it currently has a 95/100 mean score on review aggregator Metacritic. In its first week of release, Black Messiah debuted at number five on the Billboard 200 and sold 117,000 copies in the United States. In its second week, the album dropped to number twenty five on the chart and sold another 40,254 copies. In the United Kingdom, it debuted at number 47 on the UK Albums Chart with first-week sales of 7,423 copies.\\nD'Angelo supported Black Messiah with a tour called The Second Coming. His band, The Vanguard, includes drummer Chris Dave, bassist Pino Palladino, guitarists Jesse Johnson and Isaiah Sharkey, vocalists Kendra Foster, Jermaine Holmes, and Charles \\\"Redd\\\" Middleton, and keyboardist Cleo \\\"Pookie\\\" Sample. The European leg commenced in Zurich on February 11, 2015, and concluded in Brussels on March 7.\\nIn June 2015, D'Angelo confirmed to Rolling Stone that he was working on more material for a new album, calling it \\\"a companion piece\\\" to Black Messiah. In 2016 Black Messiah won Best R&B Album at the 58th Annual Grammy Awards as well as Best R&B Song for \\\"Really Love\\\" which also was nominated for Record of the Year. Black Messiah, Beyonce's self-titled album (2013), Run the Jewels' Run the Jewels 2 (2014), and Kendrick Lamar's To Pimp a Butterfly (2015) were noted as laying the groundwork down for the political charged releases that happened in 2016, which included Rihanna's Anti, Kanye West's The Life of Pablo, and Beyonce's \\\"Formation\\\".D'Angelo performed Prince's \\\"Sometimes it Snows in April\\\" on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon in April 2016 accompanied by Maya Rudolph and Gretchen Lieberum as a tribute to the late musician, appearing 'overcome with emotion' at the passing of a major influence.\\n\\n\\n== Artistry ==\\nIn a 1995 interview, he discussed the influence that musician Prince had on his approach to recording his debut album, stating \\\"I was one of those guys who read the album credits and I realized that Prince was a true artist. He wrote, produced, and performed, and that's the way I wanted to do it.\\\" According to D'Angelo, the hip hop influence present on the album \\\"came from the Native Tongues movement - Tribe Called Quest, Gangstarr and Main Source.\\\" In a February 1999 interview with music journalist Toure, D'Angelo discussed his original inspirations to produce music, stating \\\"The sound and feel of my music are going to be affected by what motivates me to do it\\\". On his visit to South Carolina, D'Angelo stated that he \\\"went through this runnel, through gospel, blues, and a lot of old soul, old James Brown, early, early Sly and the Family Stone, and a lot of Jimi Hendrix\\\", and \\\"I learned a lot about music, myself, and where I want to go musically\\\". In the same interview, he cited the deaths of rappers Tupac Shakur and The Notorious B.I.G. as having a great effect on him during the period. During the production of his second studio album D'Angelo recorded numerous hours of unreleased, original material, as well as covers of his influencers' material. Collectively referred to by D'Angelo as \\\"yoda\\\", these influencers included soul artist Al Green, funk artist George Clinton, and Afrobeat artist Fela Kuti.\\n\\n\\n== Personal life ==\\nIn the 1990s, he dated soul singer Angie Stone and helped produce her debut album Black Diamond in 1999. They have a son, also named Michael, born in 1998. Following the suicide of his close friend, MTV-affiliate Fred Jordan, in April 2001, he started to develop a drinking problem. By 2005, D'Angelo's girlfriend Cannelle Santos had left him, his attorney had become displeased with him, and most of his family was not in touch with him. He also parted ways with manager Dominique Trenier and tour manager Alan Leeds. After a car accident and an arrest on DUI and marijuana possession charges, D'Angelo left Virgin Records in 2005 and checked into the Crossroads Centre rehabilitation clinic in Antigua.In the years that followed, D'Angelo's personal problems worsened, descending to drug and alcohol addiction.

They have collected a cult following, and have received press attention from blogs and magazines. Though they are often labeled as horrorcore, the group has universally dismissed it on Twitter, in interviews, and on tracks such as \\\"Sandwitches\\\". Pitchfork Media has labeled the group as indie rap. In April 2011, the group signed a deal with RED Distribution and Sony Music Entertainment to start their own label, Odd Future Records.

Hodgy states in the interview, \\\"Nah, we ain't breaking up. Nah, this ain't no weirdo shit. It's just some real shit. It's a refocus. Going from boys to men this is what it is. So it's either understand it, 'cause it will be explained-cry about it, talk shit, applaud us-we still moving.\\\" In May 2015, Tyler posted a photo on Twitter from 2010 which contained the entire Odd Future collective. He added \\\"although it's no more, those 7 letters [OFWGKTA] are forever.\\\" This was widely believed to be a confirmation of the collective's dissolution. However, the next day he explained that his tweet was misinterpreted and was merely \\\"looking at old photos with friends and thinking about how time flies.\\\" The next day, member Earl Sweatshirt wrote: \\\"No sympathy for male virgins who're in their feelings about Tyler pointing out and solidifying the obvious.\\\" This caused an Internet debate over whether \\\"the obvious\\\" was referring to Tyler's first statement or his second. On June 30, Matt Martians seemingly confirmed to AllHipHop that Odd Future had indeed broken up, but that there were \\\"no hard feelings among the members of OFWGKTA.\\\"\\\"OFWGKTA\\\" was listed on the bill for Tyler, the Creator's 4th Annual Camp Flog Gnaw Carnival. The line-up that performed included Hodgy Beats, Domo Genesis, Mike G and Left Brain. Tyler and Earl were not a part of the set due to Tyler already having a solo show and Earl having amicably distanced himself from Odd Future around the release of his second album I Don't Like Shit, I Don't Go Outside.\\nDuring the Odd Future set at the 4th Annual Camp Flog Gnaw Carnival, Hodgy Beats called out Tyler, The Creator onstage about his dissatisfaction with Tyler, and remarking how he \\\"stayed broke\\\", and was also visibly irritated when other Odd Future members thanked Tyler for the invite to the carnival. Tyler responded to Hodgy in the middle of his solo set, saying \\\"Niggas got me fucked up. I put too many niggas on. I helped too many of my motherfucking friends out, and niggas gonna come foul? You know who the fuck I'm talking about, nigga. And yes, this is real.\\\" Hodgy responded to these remarks on Twitter by saying \\\"If it wasn't for Odd Future, where would Tyler be?\\\" and \\\"Think about who built the name OF together as a unit. Now think about who took the first initial shit on OF.\\\" However, one day later, a humorous Instagram video, uploaded by Hodgy, featured him and Tyler attempting to perform handstands; possibly suggesting that the feud had been dissolved. The video was later removed.On March 11, 2016, Syd Tha Kyd officially announced her departure from Odd Future, making The Internet only a label associated act. She also stated that she has not thought of herself as a member of Odd Future as a rap group since early 2011 when The Internet formed.On May 2, 2016, the group confirmed that they are still together on their Twitter.Some rumors began to circulate in August-September 2016 about the group working together musically again after a picture was taken of Tyler, The Creator, Earl Sweatshirt, Syd Tha Kyd, Jasper Dolphin, Taco Bennett, and Matt Martians together at the Afropunk Festival. Tyler and Earl performed as EarlWolf again for the first time in years.On February 6, 2017, MellowHype confirmed they are working together once again on MindGone Vol. 1.On August 8, 2018, Taco posted a series of four 15-second videos on his Instagram story, showing an Odd Future reunion concert taking place in at The Low End Theory club in Los Angeles, as the club's final show. Members who attended included Tyler, Earl, Taco, Jasper, Syd, Hodgy, and Mike G. They performed well known tracks such as \\\"Orange Juice\\\", \\\"Rella\\\", and \\\"Sandwitches\\\". Member Left Brain posted on his Instagram story that he had no idea that it would happen, and was never invited or told.\\n\\n\\n== Members ==\\n\\n\\n=== Current members ===\\nTyler, the Creator - rapper, producer, music video director (2007-present)\\nHodgy - rapper, producer (2007-present)\\nLeft Brain - producer, DJ, rapper (2007-present)\\nPyramid Vritra - producer, rapper (2007-present)\\nFrank Ocean - singer, producer, rapper (2010-present)\\nJasper Dolphin - rapper, hypeman (2007-present)\\nEarl Sweatshirt - rapper, producer, DJ (2009-present)\\nDomo Genesis - rapper, DJ (2009-present)\\nMatt Martians - producer, singer (2007-present)\\nMike G - rapper, DJ (2009-present)\\nTaco - DJ, rapper (2009-present)\\nL-Boy - hypeman (2011-present)\\nNa'kel - rapper, hypeman (2012-present)\\nLucas Vercetti - hypeman (2009-present)\\n\\n\\n=== Former members ===\\nCasey Veggies - rapper (2007-2009)\\nbrandUn DeShay - rapper, producer (2008-2010)\\nSyd - singer, DJ, producer (2008-2016)\\n\\n\\n== Sub-groups ==\\n\\n\\n=== Current groups ===\\nThe Internet (2011-present) Syd tha Kyd\\nMatt Martians\\nPatrick Paige II\\nChristopher Smith\\nSteve Lacy\\nThe Jet Age of Tomorrow (2008-2013, 2017-present)\\nMatt Martians\\nPyramid Vritra\\nMellowHype (2008-2015, 2017-present)\\nHodgy\\nLeft Brain\\nEarlWolf (2010-present)\\nTyler, the Creator\\nEarl Sweatshirt\\nMellowHigh (2011-present)\\nHodgy\\nLeft Brain\\nDomo Genesis\\nHog Slaughta Boyz (2015-present)\\nEarl Sweatshirt\\nNa'kel\\n\\n\\n=== Former groups ===\\nI Smell Panties (2008)\\nTyler, the Creator\\nJasper Dolphin\\nThe Super D3Shay (2008-2010)\\nMatt Martians\\nPyramid Vritra\\nbrandUn DeShay\\nSweaty Martians (2012-2014)\\nEarl Sweatshirt\\nMatt Martians\\n\\n\\n== Ban on performing ==\\nOdd Future were scheduled to appear at the February, 2014 Rapture Festival in Auckland, New Zealand, as a supporting act to Eminem. The group were not on the original bill, but were substituting for Kendrick Lamar after the concert had been sold out. A campaign was launched by an anti-violence group to prevent Odd Future performing, based partly on prior occurrences of the group supposedly inciting violence by their fans towards members of the public, and by the group's lyrics allegedly supporting rape and violence towards women. Immigration New Zealand canceled the visa of some group members because of prior acts of inciting violence, including one where the group allegedly encouraged fans to attack members of the police.As of 2015, Tyler, The Creator has been banned from the United Kingdom for 3-5 years due to the allegedly homophobic and violent content of his lyrics from earlier albums such as Bastard and Goblin.\\n\\n\\n== Discography ==\\n\\n\\n=== Albums ===\\nThe OF Tape Vol. 2 (2012)\\n\\n\\n=== Mixtapes ===\\nThe Odd Future Tape (2008)\\nRadical (2010)\\n\\n\\n=== Compilations ===\\n12 Odd Future Songs (2011)\\n\\n\\n== Awards and nominations ==\\n\\n\\n== Notes ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nOfficial website \\n Media related to Odd Future Wolf Gang Kill Them All at Wikimedia Commons\", \"rev_id\": 856549246, \"accessed\": \"2018-09-03 00:23:59.864295\", \"links\": [\"Adult Swim\", \"RED Distribution\", \"New York City\", \"No Idols\", \"San Diego\", \"I Smell Panties\", \"MellowHigh (album)\", \"Los Angeles\", \"Jasper Dolphin\", \"South Central Los Angeles\", \"Twitter\", \"Domo Genesis\", \"Kendrick Lamar\", \"Wolf (Tyler, the Creator album)\", \"The OF Tape Vol. 2\", \"Numbers (Mellowhype album)\", \"Hammerstein Ballroom\", \"Odd Future\", \"Nostalgia, Ultra\", \"Left Brain\", \"She (Tyler, the Creator song)\", \"Sony Music Entertainment\", \"MellowHype\", \"London\", \"Taco Tuesday\", \"Matt Martians\", \"Odd Future Records\", \"Camp Flog Gnaw Carnival\", \"Sony Music\", \"Earl Sweatshirt\", \"Syd tha Kyd\", \"Tyler, the Creator\", \"Genesis (Domo Genesis album)\", \"Thinkin Bout You\", \"12 Odd Future Songs\", \"Numbers (MellowHype album)\", \"Casey Veggies\", \"Doris (album)\", \"Earl (mixtape)\", \"House of Blues\", \"Bastard (Tyler, the Creator album)\", \"AllHipHop\", \"Wolf (Tyler, The Creator album)\", \"Dash Radio\", \"Chicago\", \"Frank Ocean\", \"Hodgy\", \"BlackenedWhite\", \"Bastard (Tyler, The Creator album)\", \"Goblin (album)\", \"Instagram\", \"Loiter Squad\", \"The Internet (band)\", \"The Odd Future Tape\", \"XL Recordings\", \"Golf Wang\", \"Mike G\", \"Pitchfork Media\", \"Syd (singer)\", \"The Jet Age of Tomorrow\", \"MellowHigh\", \"Eminem\", \"Hodgy Beats\", \"Jackass (TV series)\", \"The Alchemist (producer)\", \"Bastard (Tyler, the Creator mixtape)\", \"Pyramid Vritra\", \"Tyler, The Creator\", \"California\", \"Billboard 200\", \"Radical (mixtape)\", \"EarlWolf\", \"Fat Possum Records\"]}, {\"title\": \"Brainfeeder\", \"link_id\": \"Brainfeeder\", \"summary\": \"Brainfeeder is an independent record label based in Los Angeles, California, founded by Flying Lotus in 2008, focusing on electronic music and instrumental hip hop.

In 2016, Thundercat won a Grammy for Best Rap/Sung Performance for his work on the track \\\"These Walls\\\" from To Pimp a Butterfly.\\n\\n\\n== Music career ==\\nBorn into a family of musicians, Bruner began playing the bass at an early age: by 15 he had a minor hit in Germany as a member of the boy band No Curfew. A year later he joined his brother Ronald Jr. as a member of the Los Angeles punk band Suicidal Tendencies, replacing former bass player Josh Paul.\\nAlong with his band duties Bruner is also a session musician, acclaimed for his work on Erykah Badu's New Amerykah (2008) and Flying Lotus' Cosmogramma (2010). He released his first solo album in 2011, The Golden Age of Apocalypse, which featured production from Flying Lotus, and was influenced by 1970s fusion artists such as Stanley Clarke and George Duke. The next two years saw a return to the recording studio with fellow Brainfeeder artist Flying Lotus, with contributions to the Lotus's Until the Quiet Comes (2012) and You're Dead! (2014), and the release of Thundercat's second album Apocalypse (2013).\\n\\n\\n=== To Pimp a Butterfly ===\\nBruner has been described as being a major contributor to and \\\"at the creative epicenter\\\" of Kendrick Lamar's critically acclaimed album To Pimp a Butterfly.Along with the involvements with previous artists, Thundercat draws inspiration from jazz musicians such as Miles Davis, Mary Lou Williams and Ron Carter. Through this, he is frequently able to renew elements from old soul, funk, and jazz albums. Known as \\\"digging in the crates\\\", this method is best used to bring the sound, feel and emotion he wants to convey in his music. An example of this can be heard on his EP released in 2015 titled The Beyond / Where the Giants Roam. The most popular track on this EP titled Them Changes, also shares this creative renewal element. Them Changes contains a drum sample from the 1977 track \\\"Footsteps in the Dark\\\" by the Isley Brothers.\\nIn 2016, Bruner revealed to XXL that he is working on a new album with Flying Lotus as a main contributor. In May of that year, Bruner appeared live with Red Hot Chili Peppers to play additional bass on their song \\\"Go Robot\\\" at iHeartRadio's release party for the band's 2016 album The Getaway. In August 2016, Bruner appeared live with singers Kenny Loggins and Michael McDonald in Chicago.\\n\\n\\n=== Drunk ===\\nIn June 2017, Thundercat appeared on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon to promote his studio album Drunk with Michael McDonald and Kenny Loggins.\\n\\n\\n== Discography ==\\n\\n\\n=== Studio albums ===\\n\\n\\n=== EPs ===\\nThe Beyond / Where the Giants Roam (2015)\\n\\n\\n=== With Kendrick Lamar ===\\nTo Pimp a Butterfly (2015)\\nUntitled Unmastered (2016)\\nDamn (2017)\\n\\n\\n=== With Kamasi Washington ===\\nLive at 5th Street Dick's (2005)\\nThe Epic (2015)\\nHarmony of Difference (2017)\\nHeaven and Earth (2018)\\n\\n\\n=== With Flying Lotus ===\\nCosmogramma  (2010)\\nPattern+Grid World (2010)\\nUntil the Quiet Comes (2012)\\nIdeas+drafts+loops (2013)\\nYou're Dead!

His father, Kenny Duckworth, was a member of a street gang called Gangster Disciples, and Lamar's family had ties to the Bloods.His first name was given to him by his mother in honor of American singer-songwriter Eddie Kendricks of The Temptations. In 1995, at the age of eight in his hometown of Compton, Lamar witnessed his idols, Tupac Shakur and Dr. Dre, film the music video for their hit single \\\"California Love\\\", which proved to be a very significant moment in his life. He grew up on welfare and section 8 housing. \\nAs a child, Lamar attended McNair Elementary and vanguard learning center in the Compton Unified School District. As a teenager, Lamar went on to attend Centennial High School in Compton, where he was a straight-A student.\\n\\n\\n== Career ==\\n\\n\\n=== 2004-2009: Career beginnings ===\\nIn 2004, at the age of 16, Lamar released his first full-length project, a mixtape titled Youngest Head Nigga in Charge (Hub City Threat: Minor of the Year), under the pseudonym K-Dot. The mixtape was released under Konkrete Jungle Muzik and garnered local recognition for Lamar. The mixtape led to Lamar securing a recording contract with Top Dawg Entertainment (TDE), a newly founded indie record label, based in Carson, California. He began recording material with the label and subsequently released a 26 track mixtape two years later, titled Training Day (2005).Throughout 2006 and 2007, Lamar would appear alongside other up-and-coming West Coast rappers, such as Jay Rock and Ya Boy, as opening acts for veteran West Coast rapper The Game. Under the moniker K-Dot, Lamar was also featured on The Game's songs \\\"The Cypha\\\" and \\\"Cali Niggaz\\\".In 2008, Lamar was prominently featured throughout the music video for Jay Rock's commercial debut single, \\\"All My Life (In the Ghetto)\\\", which features American hip hop superstar Lil Wayne and was backed by Warner Bros. Records. Lamar garnered further recognition after a video of a live performance of a Charles Hamilton show surfaced, in which Hamilton battled fellow rappers who were in the audience. Lamar did not hesitate and began rapping a verse over the instrumental to Miilkbone's \\\"Keep It Real\\\", which would later appear on a track titled \\\"West Coast Wu-Tang\\\".After receiving a co-sign from Lil Wayne, Lamar released his third mixtape in 2009, titled C4, which was heavily themed around Wayne's Tha Carter III LP. Soon after, Lamar decided to drop K-Dot as his stage name and go by his birth name. He subsequently released The Kendrick Lamar EP in late 2009. That same year, Lamar along with his TDE label-mates: Jay Rock, Ab-Soul and ScHoolboy Q formed Black Hippy, a hip hop supergroup.\\n\\n\\n=== 2010-2011: Overly Dedicated and Section.80 ===\\nThroughout 2010, Lamar toured with Tech N9ne and Jay Rock on The Independent Grind tour. On September 14, 2010, he released the visuals for \\\"P&P 1.5\\\", a song taken from Overly Dedicated, featuring his Black Hippy cohort Ab-Soul. On the same date, Lamar released Overly Dedicated to digital retailers under Top Dawg Entertainment, and later on September 23, released it for free online. The project fared well enough to enter the United States Billboard Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, where it peaked at number 72.\\nThe mixtape includes a song titled \\\"Ignorance Is Bliss\\\", in which Lamar highlights gangsta rap and street crime, but ends each verse with \\\"ignorance is bliss\\\", giving the message \\\"we know not what we do;\\\" it was this song specifically that made hip hop producer Dr. Dre want to work with Lamar after seeing the music video on YouTube. This led to Lamar working with Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg on Dre's often-delayed Detox album, as well as speculation of Lamar signing to Dr. Dre's record label, Aftermath Entertainment. In December 2010, Complex magazine spotlighted Lamar in an edition of their \\\"Indie Intro\\\" series.In early 2011, Lamar was included in XXL's annual Top 10 Freshman Class, and was featured on the cover alongside fellow up-and-coming rappers Cyhi the Prynce, Meek Mill, Mac Miller, Yelawolf and Big K.R.I.T., among others. On April 11, 2011, Lamar announced the title of his next full-length project to be Section.80, and the following day the first single \\\"HiiiPoWeR\\\" was released, the concept of which was to further explain the HiiiPoWeR movement. The song was produced by fellow American rapper J. Cole, marking their first of several collaborations.On the topic of whether his next project would be an album or a mixtape, Lamar answered: \\\"I treat every project like it's an album anyway. It's not going to be nothing leftover. I never do nothing like that. These are my leftover songs you all can have them. I'm going to put my best out. My best effort. I'm trying to look for an album in 2012.\\\" In June 2011, Lamar released \\\"Ronald Reagan Era (His Evils)\\\", a cut from Section.80, featuring Wu-Tang Clan leader RZA. On July 2, 2011, Lamar released Section.80, his first independent album, to critical acclaim. The album features guest appearances from GLC, Colin Munroe, Schoolboy Q, and Ab-Soul, while the production was handled by Top Dawg in-house production team Digi+Phonics as well as Wyldfyer, Terrace Martin and J. Cole. Section.80 went on to sell 5,300 digital copies in its first week, without any television or radio coverage and received mostly positive reviews.In August 2011, while performing at a West Los Angeles concert, Lamar was dubbed the \\\"New King of the West Coast\\\" by Snoop Dogg, Dr. Dre and Game. On August 24, 2011, Lamar released the music video for the Section.80 track, \\\"ADHD\\\". The video was directed by Vashtie Kola who had this to say of the video: \\\"Inspired by \\\"A.D.H.D\\\"'s dark beat and melancholy lyrics which explore a generation in conflict, we find Kendrick Lamar in a video that illustrates the songs[sic] universal and age-old theme of apathetic youth. (...) Shot in New York City during the sweltering July Summer heat\\\". In October 2011, Lamar appeared alongside fellow American rappers B.o.B, Tech N9ne, MGK, and Big K.R.I.T., in a cypher at the BET Hip Hop Awards.

That's the reason we chose to celebrate him, wrote an incredibly positive article declaring him the next King of Rap, and gave him our highest honor: putting him on the cover of our Men of the Year issue. I'm not sure how you can spin that into a bad thing, and I encourage anyone interested to read the story and see for themselves.\\\"Lamar received a total of seven Grammy nominations at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards (2014), including Best New Artist, Album of the Year, and Best Rap Song, but did not win in any category.

His sense of timing is impeccable. In the midst of rampant cases of police brutality and racial tension across America, he spews raw, aggressive bars while possibly cutting a rug,\\\" while Pitchfork editors noted it \\\"forced critics to think deeply about music. It's an album by the greatest rapper of his generation.\\\" Producer Tony Visconti stated David Bowie's album Blackstar (2016) was influenced by Lamar's work, \\\"we were listening to a lot of Kendrick Lamar [...] we loved the fact Kendrick was so open-minded and he didn't do a straight-up hip-hop record. He threw everything on there, and that's exactly what we wanted to do.\\\" Visconti also stated this about Lamar while talking about \\\"rule-breakers\\\" in music. \\\"His album To Pimp A Butterfly broke every rule in the book and he had a number one album glued to the top of the charts. You'd think certain labels would learn form that. But they take somebody who is out there and say, 'That's what people want.' No, people want that for one week. You don't want the same song every single day of your life.\\\"Lamar won five Grammys at the 58th ceremony, including Best Rap Album for To Pimp a Butterfly. Other nominations included Album of the Year and Song of the Year. At the ceremony, Lamar performed a medley of \\\"The Blacker the Berry\\\" and \\\"Alright\\\".

He also cites rapper DMX as an influence: \\\"[DMX] really [got me started] on music,\\\" explained Lamar in an interview with Philadelphia's Power 99. \\\"That first album [It's Dark and Hell Is Hot] is classic, [so he had an influence on me].\\\" He has also stated Eazy-E as an influence in a post by Complex saying: \\\"I Wouldn't Be Here Today If It Wasn't for Eazy-E.\\\"In a September 2012 interview, Lamar stated rapper Eminem \\\"influenced a lot of my style\\\" and has since credited Eminem for his own aggression, on records such as \\\"Backseat Freestyle\\\".

Hypocrite!\\\" which people perceived to be Lamar judging the black community. Lamar later spoke on the lyrics in a NPR interview, saying \\\"It's not me pointing at my community; it's me pointing at myself, I don't talk about these things if I haven't lived them, and I've hurt people in my life. It's something I still have to think about when I sleep at night.\\\"Following the release of Lamar's single \\\"Humble\\\", Lamar faced backlash for the lines \\\"I'm so fucking sick and tired of the Photoshop/Show me something natural like afro on Richard Pryor/Show me something natural like ass with some stretch marks,\\\" and was accused of putting down sections of women who enjoy makeup in an attempt to be uplifting.

Several more reported subliminal lines were spoken by each rapper, four by Kendrick on the songs, \\\"Pay for it\\\", \\\"King Kunta\\\", \\\"Darkside/Gone\\\" and Deep Water\\\" and two by Drake on the songs \\\"Used To\\\" and \\\"4PM In Calabasas\\\"In June 2016, former NFL player and broadcast show host, Marcellus Wiley alleged that on his ESPN show, Drake or Lamar had given an interview in which they started \\\"talking noise!\\\" and claimed that they had problems with the other individual.

Following an almost year hiatus from music, Kendrick Lamar released \\\"The Heart Part 4.\\\" It was speculated that Lamar's line \\\"One, two, three, four, five/I am the greatest rapper alive\\\" was a response to Drake's line \\\"I know I said top five, but I'm top two/And I'm not two and I got one\\\" on the song \\\"Gyalchester.\\\" Kendrick proceeded to insult rappers who have ghostwriters in an interview with Rolling Stone in August 2015. It was speculated that the insult was directed towards Drake who has been in controversy due to the use of \\\"ghostwriters\\\" on songs such as \\\"RICO.\\\"Kendrick Lamar has also been in a feud with Detroit rapper and former collaborator, Big Sean. Following the release of Sean's track \\\"Control\\\" in August 2013 where Lamar calls Sean out and claims he's gonna \\\"murder\\\" him, Sean responded in praise, saying \\\"Alright, that's what it need to get back to, it need to get back to hip-hop, that culture.\\\" In January 2015, Sean later spoke on \\\"Control\\\", saying that the song was \\\"negative\\\" and then a month later releasing \\\"Me, Myself, and I\\\" freestyle with lines speculated to be directed at Kendrick.

Initially only five positions long, the album chart was not published on a weekly basis, sometimes three to seven weeks passing before it was updated. A biweekly (though with a few gaps), 15-position Best-Selling Popular Albums chart appeared in 1955. With the increase in album sales as the early 1950s format wars stabilized into market dominance by 45 RPM singles and long-playing twelve-inch albums, with 78 RPM record and long-playing ten-inch album sales decreasing dramatically, Billboard premiered a weekly Best-Selling Popular Albums chart on March 24, 1956. The position count varied anywhere from 10 to 30 albums. The first number-one album on the new weekly list was Belafonte by Harry Belafonte. The chart was renamed to Best-Selling Pop Albums later in 1956, and then to Best-Selling Pop LPs in 1957.\\nBeginning on May 25, 1959, Billboard split the ranking into two charts Best-Selling Stereophonic LPs for stereo albums (30 positions) and Best-Selling Monophonic LPs for mono albums (50 positions). These were renamed to Stereo Action Charts (30 positions) and Mono Action Charts (40 positions) in 1960. In January 1961, they became Action Albums--Stereophonic (15 positions) and Action Albums--Monophonic (25 positions). Three months later, they became Top LPs--Stereo (50 positions) and Top LPs--Monaural (150 positions).\\nOn August 17, 1963 the stereo and mono charts were combined into a 150-position chart called Top LPs. On April 1, 1967, the chart was expanded to 175 positions, then finally to 200 positions on May 13, 1967. In February 1972, the album chart's title was changed to Top LPs & Tape; in 1984, it was retitled Top 200 Albums; in 1985, it was retitled again to Top Pop Albums; in 1991, it became The Billboard 200 Top Albums; and it was given its current title of The Billboard 200 on March 14, 1992.\\n\\n\\n=== Catalog albums ===\\nIn 1960, Billboard began concurrently publishing album charts which ranked sales of older or mid-priced titles. These Essential Inventory charts were divided by stereo and mono albums, and featured titles that had already appeared on the main stereo and mono album charts. Mono albums were moved to the Essential Inventory--Mono chart (25 positions) after spending 40 weeks on the Mono Action Chart, and stereo albums were moved to the Essential Inventory--Stereo chart (20 positions) after 20 weeks on the Stereo Action Chart.\\nIn January 1961, the Action Charts became Action Albums--Monophonic (24 positions), and Action Albums--Stereophonic (15 positions). Albums appeared on either chart for up to nine weeks, then were moved to an Essential Inventory list of approximately 200 titles, with no numerical ranking. This list continued to be published until the consolidated Top LPs chart debuted in 1963.\\nIn 1982, Billboard began publishing a Midline Albums chart (alternatively titled Midline LPs) which ranked older or mid-priced titles. The chart held 50 positions and was published on a bi-weekly (and later tri-weekly) basis.\\nOn May 25, 1991, Billboard premiered the Top Pop Catalog Albums chart. The criteria for this chart were albums that were more than 18 months old and had fallen below position 100 on the Billboard 200. An album needed not have charted on the Billboard 200 at all to qualify for catalog status.\\nStarting with the issue dated December 5, 2009, however, the catalog limitations which removed albums over 18 months old, that have dropped below position 100 and have no currently-running single, from the Billboard 200 was lifted, turning the chart into an all-inclusive list of the 200 highest-selling albums in the country (essentially changing Top Comprehensive Albums into the Billboard 200). A new chart that keeps the previous criteria for the Billboard 200 (dubbed Top Current Albums) was also introduced in the same issue.\\n\\n\\n=== Holiday albums ===\\nBillboard has adjusted its policies for Christmas and holiday albums several times. The albums were eligible for the main album charts until 1963, when a Christmas Albums list was created. Albums appearing here were not listed on the Top LPs chart. In 1974, this rule was reverted and holiday albums again appeared within the main list.\\nIn 1983, the Christmas Albums chart was resurrected, but a title's appearance here did not disqualify it from appearing on the Top Pop Albums chart. In 1994 the chart was retitled Top Holiday Albums. As of 2009 the chart holds 50 positions and is run for several weeks during the end-of-calendar-year holiday season. Its current policy allows holiday albums to concurrently chart on the Top Holiday Albums list and the Billboard 200.\\n\\n\\n=== Nielsen SoundScan ===\\nSince May 25, 1991, the Billboard 200's positions have been derived from Nielsen SoundScan sales data, as of  2008 contributed by approximately 14,000 music sellers. Because these numbers are supplied by a subset of sellers rather than record labels, it is common for these numbers to be substantially lower than those reported by the Recording Industry Association of America when Gold, Platinum and Diamond album awards are announced (RIAA awards reflect wholesale shipments, not retail sales).\\n\\n\\n=== Incorporation of streaming data and track sales ===\\n\\nBeginning with the December 13, 2014 issue, Billboard updated the methodology of its album chart again, changing from a \\\"pure sales-based ranking\\\" to one measuring \\\"multi-metric consumption\\\". With this overhaul, the Billboard 200 includes on-demand streaming and digital track sales (as measured by Nielsen SoundScan) by way of a new algorithm, utilizing data from all of the major on-demand audio subscription services including Spotify, Beats Music, Google Play and Xbox Music. Under the new methodology, ten track sales or 1,500 song streams from an album are treated as equivalent to one purchase of the album. Billboard will continue to publish a pure album sales chart, called Top Album Sales, that maintains the traditional Billboard 200 methodology, based exclusively on SoundScan's sales data.\\n\\n\\n== Year-end charts ==\\nBillboard's \\\"chart year\\\" runs from the first week of December to the final week in November. This altered calendar allows for Billboard to calculate year-end charts and release them in time for its final print issue in the last week of December. Prior to Nielsen SoundScan, year-end charts were calculated by an inverse-point system based solely on an album's performance on the Billboard 200 (for example, an album would be given one point for a week spent at position 200, two points for a week spent at position 199... up to 200 points for each week spent at number one). Other factors including the total weeks on the chart and at its peak position were calculated into an album's year-end total.\\nAfter Billboard began obtaining sales information from Nielsen SoundScan, the year-end charts are now calculated by a very straightforward cumulative total of yearlong sales. This gives a more accurate picture of any given year's best-selling albums, as a title that hypothetically spent nine weeks at number one in March could possibly have sold fewer copies than one spending six weeks at number three in January. Albums at the peak of their popularity at the time of the November/December chart-year cutoff many times end up ranked lower than one would expect on a year-end tally, yet are ranked on the following year's chart as well, as their cumulative points are split between the two chart-years.\\n\\n\\n== Uses ==\\nThe Billboard 200 can be helpful to radio stations as an indication of the types of music listeners are interested in hearing. Retailers can also find it useful as a way to determine which recordings should be given the most prominent display in a store. Other outlets, such as airline music services, also employ the Billboard charts to determine their programming.\\n\\n\\n== All-Time Billboard 200 achievements (1963-2015) ==\\nIn 2015, Billboard magazine compiled a ranking of the 100 best-performing albums on the chart over the 52 years, along with the best-performing artists.

Her first was the 1964 album People and her most recent was the 2016 album Encore: Movie Partners Sing Broadway, with a few weeks shy of 52 years between the two hitting number 1.\\nThe first album to debut at number one was Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy by Elton John. John repeated the same feat with the album Rock of the Westies - the second album to debut at number one - making John the first artist to have two consecutive studio albums debut at number one. Whitney Houston's second album Whitney was the first album by a female artist to debut at number one.\\nIn the early 1960s, Bob Newhart had the accomplishment of having the number-one and number-two albums simultaneously on the Billboard albums chart, with The Button-Down Mind of Bob Newhart and The Button-Down Mind Strikes Back! This feat was equaled by The Beatles multiple times. They did this twice in 1964 with Meet The Beatles! and Introducing... The Beatles, and then with A Hard Day's Night and Something New, followed in 1969 with the album The Beatles (commonly known as The White Album) and the soundtrack for the film Yellow Submarine. In 1991, Guns N' Roses held the top two with Use Your Illusion I and Use Your Illusion II, in 2004, Nelly's Suit and Sweat and in 2017, Future's Future and HNDRXX.\\nAs a musician, Paul McCartney has the most number-one albums, with 25.

The album spent a record 937 weeks on the Billboard 200. The other weeks were spent on the Top Pop Catalog Albums chart. Its closest rival is Bob Marley's Legend, checking in at over 975 weeks (Billboard 200 and Top Pop Catalog Albums combined).\\nTapestry by Carole King holds the record for most consecutive weeks at number one on the Billboard 200 for any one album by a female solo artist with 15 weeks.\\nThe only EPs to reach number one on the chart are Alice in Chains's Jar of Flies in 1994, Linkin Park and Jay-Z's collaboration EP, Collision Course in 2004, the cast of the television series Glee with Glee: The Music, The Power of Madonna and Glee: The Music, Journey to Regionals in 2010, and Bad Meets Evil's Hell: The Sequel in 2011.\\nIn 2001, Britney Spears became the first female artist her first three albums debut at number one.

James's older brother, King Charles II, had appointed the Duke proprietor of the former territory of New Netherland, including the city of New Amsterdam, which England had recently seized from the Dutch.\\n\\n\\n=== Early history ===\\nDuring the Wisconsinan glaciation, the New York City region was situated at the edge of a large ice sheet over 1,000 feet (300 m) in depth. The ice sheet scraped away large amounts of regolith, leaving the bedrock that serves as the geologic foundation for much of New York City today. Later on, movement of the ice sheet contributed to the separation of what are now Long Island and Staten Island.In the precolonial era, the area of present-day New York City was inhabited by Algonquian Native Americans, including the Lenape, whose homeland, known as Lenapehoking, included Staten Island; the western portion of Long Island, including the area that would become Brooklyn and Queens; Manhattan; the Bronx; and the Lower Hudson Valley.The first documented visit into New York Harbor by a European was in 1524 by Giovanni da Verrazzano, a Florentine explorer in the service of the French crown. He claimed the area for France and named it Nouvelle Angouleme (New Angouleme). A Spanish expedition led by captain Estevao Gomes, a Portuguese sailing for Emperor Charles V, arrived in New York Harbor in January 1525 and charted the mouth of the Hudson River, which he named Rio de San Antonio (Saint Anthony's River). The Padron Real of 1527, the first scientific map to show the East Coast of North America continuously, was informed by Gomes' expedition and labeled the northeastern United States as Tierra de Esteban Gomez in his honor.\\n\\nIn 1609, the English explorer Henry Hudson rediscovered the New York Harbor while searching for the Northwest Passage to the Orient for the Dutch East India Company. He proceeded to sail up what the Dutch would name the North River (now the Hudson River), named first by Hudson as the Mauritius after Maurice, Prince of Orange. Hudson's first mate described the harbor as \\\"a very good Harbour for all windes\\\" and the river as \\\"a mile broad\\\" and \\\"full of fish.\\\" Hudson sailed roughly 150 miles (240 km) north, past the site of the  present-day New York State capital city of Albany, in the belief that it might be an oceanic tributary before the river became too shallow to continue. He made a ten-day exploration of the area and claimed the region for the Dutch East India Company. In 1614, the area between Cape Cod and Delaware Bay was claimed by the Netherlands and called Nieuw-Nederland (New Netherland).\\nThe first non-Native American inhabitant of what would eventually become New York City was Juan Rodriguez (transliterated to Dutch as Jan Rodrigues), a merchant from Santo Domingo. Born in Santo Domingo of Portuguese and African descent, he arrived in Manhattan during the winter of 1613-1614, trapping for pelts and trading with the local population as a representative of the Dutch. Broadway, from 159th Street to 218th Street in Upper Manhattan, is named Juan Rodriguez Way in his honor.\\n\\n\\n=== Dutch rule ===\\nA permanent European presence in New Netherland began in 1624 - making New York the 12th oldest continuously occupied European-established settlement in the continental United States - with the founding of a Dutch fur trading settlement on Governors Island. In 1625, construction was started on a citadel and Fort Amsterdam, later called Nieuw Amsterdam (New Amsterdam), on present-day Manhattan Island. The colony of New Amsterdam was centered at the site which would eventually become Lower Manhattan. In 1626, the Dutch colonial Director-General Peter Minuit, acting as charged by the Dutch West India Company, purchased the island of Manhattan from the Canarsie, a small Lenape band, for 60 guilders (about $1,000 in 2006). A disproved legend claims that Manhattan was purchased for $24 worth of glass beads.Following the purchase, New Amsterdam grew slowly. To attract settlers, the Dutch instituted the patroon system in 1628, whereby wealthy Dutchmen (patroons, or patrons) who brought 50 colonists to New Netherland would be awarded swathes of land, along with local political autonomy and rights to participate in the lucrative fur trade. This program had little success.Since 1621, the Dutch West India Company had operated as a monopoly in New Netherland, on authority granted by the Dutch States General. In 1639-1640, in an effort to bolster economic growth, the Dutch West India Company relinquished its monopoly over the fur trade, leading to growth in the production and trade of food, timber, tobacco, and slaves (particularly with the Dutch West Indies).In 1647, Peter Stuyvesant began his tenure as the last Director-General of New Netherland. During his tenure, the population of New Netherland grew from 2,000 to 8,000. Stuyvesant has been credited with improving law and order in the colony; however, he also earned a reputation as a despotic leader. He instituted regulations on liquor sales, attempted to assert control over the Dutch Reformed Church, and blocked other religious groups (including Quakers, Jews, and Lutherans) from establishing houses of worship. The Dutch West India Company would eventually attempt to ease tensions between Stuyvesant and residents of New Amsterdam.\\n\\n\\n=== English rule ===\\n\\nIn 1664, unable to summon any significant resistance, Stuyvesant surrendered New Amsterdam to English troops, led by Colonel Richard Nicolls, without bloodshed. The terms of the surrender permitted Dutch residents to remain in the colony and allowed for religious freedom. The English promptly renamed the fledgling city \\\"New York\\\" after the Duke of York (the future King James II of England). The transfer was confirmed in 1667 by the Treaty of Breda, which concluded the Second Anglo-Dutch War.On August 24, 1673, during the Third Anglo-Dutch War, Dutch captain Anthony Colve seized the colony of New York from England at the behest of Cornelis Evertsen the Youngest and rechristened it \\\"New Orange\\\" after William III, the Prince of Orange. The Dutch would soon return the island to England under the Treaty of Westminster of November 1674.Several intertribal wars among the Native Americans and some epidemics brought on by contact with the Europeans caused sizeable population losses for the Lenape between the years 1660 and 1670. By 1700, the Lenape population had diminished to 200. New York experienced several yellow fever epidemics in the 18th century, losing ten percent of its population to the disease in 1702 alone.New York grew in importance as a trading port while under British rule in the early 1700s. It also became a center of slavery, with 42% of households holding slaves by 1730, the highest percentage outside Charleston, South Carolina. Most slaveholders held a few or several domestic slaves, but others hired them out to work at labor. Slavery became integrally tied to New York's economy through the labor of slaves throughout the port, and the banks and shipping tied to the American South. Discovery of the African Burying Ground in the 1990s, during construction of a new federal courthouse near Foley Square, revealed that tens of thousands of Africans had been buried in the area in the colonial years.\\nThe 1735 trial and acquittal in Manhattan of John Peter Zenger, who had been accused of seditious libel after criticizing colonial governor William Cosby, helped to establish the freedom of the press in North America. In 1754, Columbia University was founded under charter by King George II as King's College in Lower Manhattan.\\n\\n\\n=== American Revolution ===\\n\\nThe Stamp Act Congress met in New York in October 1765, as the Sons of Liberty, organized in the city, skirmished over the next ten years with British troops stationed there. The Battle of Long Island, the largest battle of the American Revolutionary War, was fought in August 1776 within the modern-day borough of Brooklyn. After the battle, in which the Americans were defeated, the British made the city their military and political base of operations in North America. The city was a haven for Loyalist refugees and escaped slaves who joined the British lines for freedom newly promised by the Crown for all fighters. As many as 10,000 escaped slaves crowded into the city during the British occupation. When the British forces evacuated at the close of the war in 1783, they transported 3,000 freedmen for resettlement in Nova Scotia. They resettled other freedmen in England and the Caribbean.\\nThe only attempt at a peaceful solution to the war took place at the Conference House on Staten Island between American delegates, including Benjamin Franklin, and British general Lord Howe on September 11, 1776. Shortly after the British occupation began, the Great Fire of New York occurred, a large conflagration on the West Side of Lower Manhattan, which destroyed about a quarter of the buildings in the city, including Trinity Church.In 1785, the assembly of the Congress of the Confederation made New York City the national capital shortly after the war. New York was the last capital of the U.S. under the Articles of Confederation and the first capital under the Constitution of the United States. In 1789, the first President of the United States, George Washington, was inaugurated; the first United States Congress and the Supreme Court of the United States each assembled for the first time, and the United States Bill of Rights was drafted, all at Federal Hall on Wall Street. By 1790, New York had surpassed Philadelphia as the largest city in the United States.\\n\\n\\n=== Nineteenth century ===\\n\\nUnder New York State's gradual abolition act of 1799, children of slave mothers were to be eventually liberated but to be held in indentured servitude until their mid-to-late twenties. Together with slaves freed by their masters after the Revolutionary War and escaped slaves, a significant free-black population gradually developed in Manhattan. Under such influential United States founders as Alexander Hamilton and John Jay, the New York Manumission Society worked for abolition and established the African Free School to educate black children. It was not until 1827 that slavery was completely abolished in the state, and free blacks struggled afterward with discrimination. New York interracial abolitionist activism continued; among its leaders were graduates of the African Free School. The city's black population reached more than 16,000 in 1840.In the 19th century, the city was transformed by development relating to its status as a trading center, as well as by European immigration. The city adopted the Commissioners' Plan of 1811, which expanded the city street grid to encompass all of Manhattan. The 1825 completion of the Erie Canal through central New York connected the Atlantic port to the agricultural markets and commodities of the North American interior via the Hudson River and the Great Lakes. Local politics became dominated by Tammany Hall, a political machine supported by Irish and German immigrants.Several prominent American literary figures lived in New York during the 1830s and 1840s, including William Cullen Bryant, Washington Irving, Herman Melville, Rufus Wilmot Griswold, John Keese, Nathaniel Parker Willis, and Edgar Allan Poe. Public-minded members of the contemporaneous business elite lobbied for the establishment of Central Park, which in 1857 became the first landscaped park in an American city.\\n\\nThe Great Irish Famine brought a large influx of Irish immigrants, of whom over 200,000 were living in New York by 1860, upwards of a quarter of the city's population. There was also extensive immigration from the German provinces, where revolutions had disrupted societies, and Germans comprised another 25% of New York's population by 1860.Democratic Party candidates were consistently elected to local office, increasing the city's ties to the South and its dominant party. In 1861, Mayor Fernando Wood called upon the aldermen to declare independence from Albany and the United States after the South seceded, but his proposal was not acted on. Anger at new military conscription laws during the American Civil War (1861-1865), which spared wealthier men who could afford to pay a $300 (equivalent to $5,963 in 2017) commutation fee to hire a substitute, led to the Draft Riots of 1863, whose most visible participants were ethnic Irish working class. The situation deteriorated into attacks on New York's elite, followed by attacks on black New Yorkers and their property after fierce competition for a decade between Irish immigrants and black people for work. Rioters burned the Colored Orphan Asylum to the ground, with more than 200 children escaping harm due to efforts of the New York City Police Department, which was mainly made up of Irish immigrants. According to historian James M. McPherson (2001), at least 120 people were killed. In all, eleven black men were lynched over five days, and the riots forced hundreds of blacks to flee the city for Williamsburg, Brooklyn, and New Jersey; the black population in Manhattan fell below 10,000 by 1865, which it had last been in 1820. The white working class had established dominance. Violence by longshoremen against black men was especially fierce in the docks area. It was one of the worst incidents of civil unrest in American history.\\n\\n\\n=== Modern history ===\\n\\nIn 1898, the modern City of New York was formed with the consolidation of Brooklyn (until then a separate city), the County of New York (which then included parts of the Bronx), the County of Richmond, and the western portion of the County of Queens. The opening of the subway in 1904, first built as separate private systems, helped bind the new city together. Throughout the first half of the 20th century, the city became a world center for industry, commerce, and communication.\\nIn 1904, the steamship General Slocum caught fire in the East River, killing 1,021 people on board. In 1911, the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire, the city's worst industrial disaster, took the lives of 146 garment workers and spurred the growth of the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union and major improvements in factory safety standards.\\n\\nNew York's non-white population was 36,620 in 1890. New York City was a prime destination in the early twentieth century for African Americans during the Great Migration from the American South, and by 1916, New York City had become home to the largest urban African diaspora in North America. The Harlem Renaissance of literary and cultural life flourished during the era of Prohibition. The larger economic boom generated construction of skyscrapers competing in height and creating an identifiable skyline.\\nNew York became the most populous urbanized area in the world in the early 1920s, overtaking London. The metropolitan area surpassed the 10 million mark in the early 1930s, becoming the first megacity in human history. The difficult years of the Great Depression saw the election of reformer Fiorello La Guardia as mayor and the fall of Tammany Hall after eighty years of political dominance.Returning World War II veterans created a post-war economic boom and the development of large housing tracts in eastern Queens and Nassau County as well as similar suburban areas in New Jersey. New York emerged from the war unscathed as the leading city of the world, with Wall Street leading America's place as the world's dominant economic power. The United Nations Headquarters was completed in 1952, solidifying New York's global geopolitical influence, and the rise of abstract expressionism in the city precipitated New York's displacement of Paris as the center of the art world.\\n\\nThe Stonewall riots were a series of spontaneous, violent demonstrations by members of the gay community against a police raid that took place in the early morning hours of June 28, 1969, at the Stonewall Inn in the Greenwich Village neighborhood of Lower Manhattan. They are widely considered to constitute the single most important event leading to the gay liberation movement and the modern fight for LGBT rights in the United States.In the 1970s, job losses due to industrial restructuring caused New York City to suffer from economic problems and rising crime rates. While a resurgence in the financial industry greatly improved the city's economic health in the 1980s, New York's crime rate continued to increase through that decade and into the beginning of the 1990s. By the mid 1990s, crime rates started to drop dramatically due to revised police strategies, improving economic opportunities, gentrification, and new residents, both American transplants and new immigrants from Asia and Latin America. Important new sectors, such as Silicon Alley, emerged in the city's economy. New York's population reached all-time highs in the 2000 Census and then again in the 2010 Census.\\n\\nThe city and surrounding area suffered the bulk of the economic damage and largest loss of human life in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 attacks when 10 of the 19 terrorists associated with Al-Qaeda piloted American Airlines Flight 11 into the North Tower of the World Trade Center and United Airlines Flight 175 into the South Tower of the World Trade Center, and later destroyed them, killing 2,192 civilians, 343 firefighters, and 71 law enforcement officers who were in the towers and in the surrounding area. The North Tower was subsequently the tallest building ever to be destroyed and still is. The rebuilding of the area, has created a new One World Trade Center, and a 9/11 memorial and museum along with other new buildings and infrastructure. The World Trade Center PATH station, which opened on July 19, 1909 as the Hudson Terminal, was also destroyed in the attack. A temporary station was built and opened on November 23, 2003. An 800,000-square-foot (74,000 m2) permanent station designed by Santiago Calatrava, the World Trade Center Transportation Hub, the city's third-largest hub, was completed in 2016. The new One World Trade Center is the tallest skyscraper in the Western Hemisphere and the sixth-tallest building in the world by pinnacle height, with its spire reaching a symbolic 1,776 feet (541.3 m) in reference to the year of U.S. independence.The Occupy Wall Street protests in Zuccotti Park in the Financial District of Lower Manhattan began on September 17, 2011, receiving global attention and popularizing the Occupy movement against social and economic inequality worldwide.\\n\\n\\n== Geography ==\\n\\nNew York City is situated in the Northeastern United States, in southeastern New York State, approximately halfway between Washington, D.C. and Boston. The location at the mouth of the Hudson River, which feeds into a naturally sheltered harbor and then into the Atlantic Ocean, has helped the city grow in significance as a trading port. Most of New York City is built on the three islands of Long Island, Manhattan, and Staten Island.\\nThe Hudson River flows through the Hudson Valley into New York Bay. Between New York City and Troy, New York, the river is an estuary. The Hudson River separates the city from the U.S. state of New Jersey. The East River--a tidal strait--flows from Long Island Sound and separates the Bronx and Manhattan from Long Island. The Harlem River, another tidal strait between the East and Hudson Rivers, separates most of Manhattan from the Bronx. The Bronx River, which flows through the Bronx and Westchester County, is the only entirely fresh water river in the city.The city's land has been altered substantially by human intervention, with considerable land reclamation along the waterfronts since Dutch colonial times; reclamation is most prominent in Lower Manhattan, with developments such as Battery Park City in the 1970s and 1980s. Some of the natural relief in topography has been evened out, especially in Manhattan.The city's total area is 468.484 square miles (1,213.37 km2), including 302.643 sq mi (783.84 km2) of land and 165.841 sq mi (429.53 km2) of this is water.\\nThe highest point in the city is Todt Hill on Staten Island, which, at 409.8 feet (124.9 m) above sea level, is the highest point on the Eastern Seaboard south of Maine. The summit of the ridge is mostly covered in woodlands as part of the Staten Island Greenbelt.\\n\\n\\n=== Cityscapes ===\\n\\n\\n=== Architecture ===\\n\\nNew York has architecturally noteworthy buildings in a wide range of styles and from distinct time periods, from the saltbox style Pieter Claesen Wyckoff House in Brooklyn, the oldest section of which dates to 1656, to the modern One World Trade Center, the skyscraper at Ground Zero in Lower Manhattan and the most expensive office tower in the world by construction cost.Manhattan's skyline, with its many skyscrapers, is universally recognized, and the city has been home to several of the tallest buildings in the world. As of  2011, New York City had 5,937 high-rise buildings, of which 550 completed structures were at least 330 feet (100 m) high, both second in the world after Hong Kong, with over 50 completed skyscrapers taller than 656 feet (200 m). These include the Woolworth Building, an early example of Gothic Revival architecture in skyscraper design, built with massively scaled Gothic detailing; completed in 1913, for 17 years it was the world's tallest building.The 1916 Zoning Resolution required setbacks in new buildings and restricted towers to a percentage of the lot size, to allow sunlight to reach the streets below. The Art Deco style of the Chrysler Building (1930) and Empire State Building (1931), with their tapered tops and steel spires, reflected the zoning requirements. The buildings have distinctive ornamentation, such as the eagles at the corners of the 61st floor on the Chrysler Building, and are considered some of the finest examples of the Art Deco style. A highly influential example of the international style in the United States is the Seagram Building (1957), distinctive for its facade using visible bronze-toned I-beams to evoke the building's structure. The Conde Nast Building (2000) is a prominent example of green design in American skyscrapers and has received an award from the American Institute of Architects and AIA New York State for its design.\\nThe character of New York's large residential districts is often defined by the elegant brownstone rowhouses and townhouses and shabby tenements that were built during a period of rapid expansion from 1870 to 1930. In contrast, New York City also has neighborhoods that are less densely populated and feature free-standing dwellings. In neighborhoods such as Riverdale (in the Bronx), Ditmas Park (in Brooklyn), and Douglaston (in Queens), large single-family homes are common in various architectural styles such as Tudor Revival and Victorian.Stone and brick became the city's building materials of choice after the construction of wood-frame houses was limited in the aftermath of the Great Fire of 1835. A distinctive feature of many of the city's buildings is the wooden roof-mounted water tower. In the 1800s, the city required their installation on buildings higher than six stories to prevent the need for excessively high water pressures at lower elevations, which could break municipal water pipes. Garden apartments became popular during the 1920s in outlying areas, such as Jackson Heights.According to the United States Geological Survey, an updated analysis of seismic hazard in July 2014 revealed a \\\"slightly lower hazard for tall buildings\\\" in New York City than previously assessed. Scientists estimated this lessened risk based upon a lower likelihood than previously thought of slow shaking near the city, which would be more likely to cause damage to taller structures from an earthquake in the vicinity of the city.\\n\\n\\n=== Boroughs ===\\n\\nNew York City is often referred to collectively as the five boroughs, and in turn, there are hundreds of distinct neighborhoods throughout the boroughs, many with a definable history and character to call their own. If the boroughs were each independent cities, four of the boroughs (Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan, and the Bronx) would be among the ten most populous cities in the United States (Staten island would be ranked 37th) ; these same boroughs are coterminous with the four most densely populated counties in the United States (New York [Manhattan], Kings [Brooklyn], Bronx, and Queens).\\n\\nManhattan (New York County) is the geographically smallest and most densely populated borough, is home to Central Park and most of the city's skyscrapers, and may be locally known simply as The City. Manhattan's (New York County's) population density of 72,033 people per square mile (27,812/km2) in 2015 makes it the highest of any county in the United States and higher than the density of any individual American city. Manhattan is the cultural, administrative, and financial center of New York City and contains the headquarters of many major multinational corporations, the United Nations Headquarters, Wall Street, and a number of important universities. Manhattan is often described as the financial and cultural center of the world.Most of the borough is situated on Manhattan Island, at the mouth of the Hudson River. Several small islands also compose part of the borough of Manhattan, including Randall's Island, Wards Island, and Roosevelt Island in the East River, and Governors Island and Liberty Island to the south in New York Harbor. Manhattan Island is loosely divided into Lower, Midtown, and Uptown regions. Uptown Manhattan is divided by Central Park into the Upper East Side and the Upper West Side, and above the park is Harlem. The borough also includes a small neighborhood on the United States mainland, called Marble Hill, which is contiguous with The Bronx. New York City's remaining four boroughs are collectively referred to as the outer boroughs.\\nBrooklyn (Kings County), on the western tip of Long Island, is the city's most populous borough. Brooklyn is known for its cultural, social, and ethnic diversity, an independent art scene, distinct neighborhoods, and a distinctive architectural heritage. Downtown Brooklyn is the largest central core neighborhood in the outer boroughs. The borough has a long beachfront shoreline including Coney Island, established in the 1870s as one of the earliest amusement grounds in the country. Marine Park and Prospect Park are the two largest parks in Brooklyn. Since 2010, Brooklyn has evolved into a thriving hub of entrepreneurship and high technology startup firms, and of postmodern art and design.\\nQueens (Queens County), on Long Island north and east of Brooklyn, is geographically the largest borough, the most ethnically diverse county in the United States, and the most ethnically diverse urban area in the world. Historically a collection of small towns and villages founded by the Dutch, the borough has since developed both commercial and residential prominence. Downtown Flushing has become one of the busiest central core neighborhoods in the outer boroughs. Queens is the site of Citi Field, the baseball stadium of the New York Mets, and hosts the annual U.S. Open tennis tournament at Flushing Meadows-Corona Park. Additionally, two of the three busiest airports serving the New York metropolitan area, John F. Kennedy International Airport and LaGuardia Airport, are located in Queens. (The third is Newark Liberty International Airport in Newark, New Jersey.)\\nStaten Island (Richmond County) is the most suburban in character of the five boroughs. Staten Island is connected to Brooklyn by the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, and to Manhattan by way of the free Staten Island Ferry, a daily commuter ferry which provides unobstructed views of the Statue of Liberty, Ellis Island, and Lower Manhattan. In central Staten Island, the Staten Island Greenbelt spans approximately 2,500 acres (10 km2), including 28 miles (45 km) of walking trails and one of the last undisturbed forests in the city. Designated in 1984 to protect the island's natural lands, the Greenbelt comprises seven city parks.\\nThe Bronx (Bronx County) is New York City's northernmost borough and the only New York City borough with a majority of it a part of the mainland United States. It is the location of Yankee Stadium, the baseball park of the New York Yankees, and home to the largest cooperatively owned housing complex in the United States, Co-op City. It is also home to the Bronx Zoo, the world's largest metropolitan zoo, which spans 265 acres (1.07 km2) and houses over 6,000 animals. The Bronx is also the birthplace of rap and hip hop culture. Pelham Bay Park is the largest park in New York City, at 2,772 acres (1,122 ha).\\n\\n\\n=== Climate ===\\n\\nUnder the Koppen climate classification, using the 0 degC (32 degF) isotherm, New York City features a humid subtropical climate (Cfa), and is thus the northernmost major city on the North American continent with this categorization. The suburbs to the immediate north and west lie in the transitional zone between humid subtropical and humid continental climates (Dfa). Annually, the city averages 234 days with at least some sunshine. The city lies in the USDA 7b plant hardiness zone.Winters are cold and damp, and prevailing wind patterns that blow offshore temper the moderating effects of the Atlantic Ocean; yet the Atlantic and the partial shielding from colder air by the Appalachians keep the city warmer in the winter than inland North American cities at similar or lesser latitudes such as Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, and Indianapolis. The daily mean temperature in January, the area's coldest month, is 32.6 degF (0.3 degC); temperatures usually drop to 10 degF (-12 degC) several times per winter, and reach 60 degF (16 degC) several days in the coldest winter month. Spring and autumn are unpredictable and can range from chilly to warm, although they are usually mild with low humidity. Summers are typically warm to hot and humid, with a daily mean temperature of 76.5 degF (24.7 degC) in July. Nighttime conditions are often exacerbated by the urban heat island phenomenon, while daytime temperatures exceed 90 degF (32 degC) on average of 17 days each summer and in some years exceed 100 degF (38 degC). Extreme temperatures have ranged from -15 degF (-26 degC), recorded on February 9, 1934, up to 106 degF (41 degC) on July 9, 1936. The average water temperature of the nearby Atlantic Ocean ranges from 39.7 degF (4.3 degC) in February to 74.1 degF (23.4 degC) in August.The city receives 49.9 inches (1,270 mm) of precipitation annually, which is relatively evenly spread throughout the year. Average winter snowfall between 1981 and 2010 has been 25.8 inches (66 cm); this varies considerably between years. Hurricanes and tropical storms are rare in the New York area. Hurricane Sandy brought a destructive storm surge to New York City on the evening of October 29, 2012, flooding numerous streets, tunnels, and subway lines in Lower Manhattan and other areas of the city and cutting off electricity in many parts of the city and its suburbs. The storm and its profound impacts have prompted the discussion of constructing seawalls and other coastal barriers around the shorelines of the city and the metropolitan area to minimize the risk of destructive consequences from another such event in the future.\\n\\nSee or edit raw graph data.\\n\\n\\n=== Parks ===\\n\\nThe City of New York has a complex park system, with various lands operated by the National Park Service, the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation, and the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation.\\nIn its 2013 ParkScore ranking, The Trust for Public Land reported that the park system in New York City was the second best park system among the 50 most populous US cities, behind the park system of Minneapolis. ParkScore ranks urban park systems by a formula that analyzes median park size, park acres as percent of city area, the percent of city residents within a half-mile of a park, spending of park services per resident, and the number of playgrounds per 10,000 residents.\\n\\n\\n==== National parks ====\\n\\nGateway National Recreation Area contains over 26,000 acres (10,521.83 ha) in total, most of it surrounded by New York City, including the Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge. In Brooklyn and Queens, the park contains over 9,000 acres (36 km2) of salt marsh, wetlands, islands, and water, including most of Jamaica Bay. Also in Queens, the park includes a significant portion of the western Rockaway Peninsula, most notably Jacob Riis Park and Fort Tilden. In Staten Island, Gateway National Recreation Area includes Fort Wadsworth, with historic pre-Civil War era Battery Weed and Fort Tompkins, and Great Kills Park, with beaches, trails, and a marina.\\nThe Statue of Liberty National Monument and Ellis Island Immigration Museum are managed by the National Park Service and are in both the states of New York and New Jersey. They are joined in the harbor by Governors Island National Monument, in New York. Historic sites under federal management on Manhattan Island include Castle Clinton National Monument; Federal Hall National Memorial; Theodore Roosevelt Birthplace National Historic Site; General Grant National Memorial (\\\"Grant's Tomb\\\"); African Burial Ground National Monument; and Hamilton Grange National Memorial. Hundreds of private properties are listed on the National Register of Historic Places or as a National Historic Landmark such as, for example, the Stonewall Inn, part of the Stonewall National Monument in Greenwich Village, as the catalyst of the modern gay rights movement.\\n\\n\\n==== State parks ====\\n\\nThere are seven state parks within the confines of New York City, including Clay Pit Ponds State Park Preserve, a natural area that includes extensive riding trails, and Riverbank State Park, a 28-acre (110,000 m2) facility that rises 69 feet (21 m) over the Hudson River.\\n\\n\\n==== City parks ====\\n\\nNew York City has over 28,000 acres (110 km2) of municipal parkland and 14 miles (23 km) of public beaches. The largest municipal park in the city is Pelham Bay Park in the Bronx, with 2,772 acres (1,122 ha).\\nCentral Park, an 843-acre (3.41 km2) park in middle-upper Manhattan, is the most visited urban park in the United States and one of the most filmed locations in the world, with 40 million visitors in 2013. The park contains a wide range of attractions; there are several lakes and ponds, two ice-skating rinks, the Central Park Zoo, the Central Park Conservatory Garden, and the 106-acre (0.43 km2) Jackie Onassis Reservoir. Indoor attractions include Belvedere Castle with its nature center, the Swedish Cottage Marionette Theater, and the historic Carousel. On October 23, 2012, hedge fund manager John A. Paulson announced a $100 million gift to the Central Park Conservancy, the largest ever monetary donation to New York City's park system.\\nWashington Square Park is a prominent landmark in the Greenwich Village neighborhood of Lower Manhattan. The Washington Square Arch at the northern gateway to the park is an iconic symbol of both New York University and Greenwich Village.\\nProspect Park in Brooklyn has a 90-acre (360,000 m2) meadow, a lake, and extensive woodlands. Within the park is the historic Battle Pass, prominent in the Battle of Long Island.\\nFlushing Meadows-Corona Park in Queens, with its 897 acres (363 ha) making it the city's fourth largest park, was the setting for the 1939 World's Fair and the 1964 World's Fair and is host to the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center and the annual United States Open Tennis Championships tournament.\\nOver a fifth of the Bronx's area, 7,000 acres (28 km2), is given over to open space and parks, including Pelham Bay Park, Van Cortlandt Park, the Bronx Zoo, and the New York Botanical Gardens.\\nIn Staten Island, the Conference House Park contains the historic Conference House, site of the only attempt of a peaceful resolution to the American Revolution which was conducted in September 1775, attended by Benjamin Franklin representing the Americans and Lord Howe representing the British Crown. The historic Burial Ridge, the largest Native American burial ground within New York City, is within the park.\\n\\n\\n=== Military installations ===\\nNew York City is home to Fort Hamilton, the U.S. military's only active duty installation within the city. The Brooklyn facility was established in 1825 on the site of a small battery utilized during the American Revolution, and it is one of America's longest serving military forts. Today Fort Hamilton serves as the headquarters of the North Atlantic Division of the United States Army Corps of Engineers and for the New York City Recruiting Battalion. It also houses the 1179th Transportation Brigade, the 722nd Aeromedical Staging Squadron, and a military entrance processing station. Other formerly active military reservations still utilized for National Guard and military training or reserve operations in the city include Fort Wadsworth in Staten Island and Fort Totten in Queens.\\n\\n\\n== Demographics ==\\n\\nNew York City is the most populous city in the United States, with an estimated record high of 8,622,698 residents as of  2017, incorporating more immigration into the city than outmigration since the 2010 United States Census. More than twice as many people live in New York City as in the second-most populous U.S. city (Los Angeles), and within a smaller area. New York City gained more residents between April 2010 and July 2014 (316,000) than any other U.S. city. New York City's population is about 43% of New York State's population and about 36% of the population of the New York metropolitan area.\\n\\n\\n=== Population density ===\\nIn 2017, the city had an estimated population density of 28,491 people per square mile (11,000/km2), rendering it the most densely populated of all municipalities housing over 100,000 residents in the United States, with several small cities (of fewer than 100,000) in adjacent Hudson County, New Jersey having greater density, as per the 2010 Census. Geographically co-extensive with New York County, the borough of Manhattan's 2017 population density of 72,918 inhabitants per square mile (28,154/km2) makes it the highest of any county in the United States and higher than the density of any individual American city.\\n\\n\\n=== Race and ethnicity ===\\n\\nThe city's population in 2010 was 44% white (33.3% non-Hispanic white), 25.5% black (23% non-Hispanic black), 0.7% Native American, and 12.7% Asian. Hispanics of any race represented 28.6% of the population, while Asians constituted the fastest-growing segment of the city's population between 2000 and 2010; the non-Hispanic white population declined 3 percent, the smallest recorded decline in decades; and for the first time since the Civil War, the number of blacks declined over a decade.\\n\\nThroughout its history, the city has been a major port of entry for immigrants into the United States; more than 12 million European immigrants were received at Ellis Island between 1892 and 1924. The term \\\"melting pot\\\" was first coined to describe densely populated immigrant neighborhoods on the Lower East Side. By 1900, Germans constituted the largest immigrant group, followed by the Irish, Jews, and Italians. In 1940, whites represented 92% of the city's population.Approximately 37% of the city's population is foreign born and more than half of all children are born to mothers who are immigrants. In New York, no single country or region of origin dominates. The ten largest sources of foreign-born individuals in the city as of  2011 were the Dominican Republic, China, Mexico, Guyana, Jamaica, Ecuador, Haiti, India, Russia, and Trinidad and Tobago, while the Bangladeshi-born immigrant population has become one of the fastest growing in the city, counting over 74,000 by 2011.Asian Americans in New York City, according to the 2010 Census, number more than one million, greater than the combined totals of San Francisco and Los Angeles. New York contains the highest total Asian population of any U.S. city proper. The New York City borough of Queens is home to the state's largest Asian American population and the largest Andean (Colombian, Ecuadorian, Peruvian, and Bolivian) populations in the United States, and is also the most ethnically diverse urban area in the world. The Chinese population constitutes the fastest-growing nationality in New York State; multiple satellites of the original Manhattan Chinatown, in Brooklyn, and around Flushing, Queens, are thriving as traditionally urban enclaves - while also expanding rapidly eastward into suburban Nassau County on Long Island, as the New York metropolitan region and New York State have become the top destinations for new Chinese immigrants, respectively, and large-scale Chinese immigration continues into New York City and surrounding areas, with the largest metropolitan Chinese diaspora outside Asia, including an estimated 812,410 individuals in 2015. In 2012, 6.3% of New York City was of Chinese ethnicity, with nearly three-fourths living in either Queens or Brooklyn, geographically on Long Island. A community numbering 20,000 Korean-Chinese (Chaoxianzu or Joseonjok) is centered in Flushing, Queens, while New York City is also home to the largest Tibetan population outside China, India, and Nepal, also centered in Queens. Koreans made up 1.2% of the city's population, and Japanese 0.3%. Filipinos were the largest Southeast Asian ethnic group at 0.8%, followed by Vietnamese, who made up 0.2% of New York City's population in 2010. Indians are the largest South Asian group, comprising 2.4% of the city's population, with Bangladeshis and Pakistanis at 0.7% and 0.5%, respectively. Queens is the preferred borough of settlement for Asian Indians, Koreans, Filipinos, and Malaysians and other Southeast Asians; while Brooklyn is receiving large numbers of both West Indian and Asian Indian immigrants.\\n\\nNew York City has the largest European and non-Hispanic white population of any American city. At 2.7 million in 2012, New York's non-Hispanic white population is larger than the non-Hispanic white populations of Los Angeles (1.1 million), Chicago (865,000), and Houston (550,000) combined. The non-Hispanic white population was 6.6 million in 1940. The non-Hispanic white population has begun to increase since 2010. The European diaspora residing in the city is very diverse. According to 2012 Census estimates, there were roughly 560,000 Italian Americans, 385,000 Irish Americans, 253,000 German Americans, 223,000 Russian Americans, 201,000 Polish Americans, and 137,000 English Americans. Additionally, Greek and French Americans numbered 65,000 each, with those of Hungarian descent estimated at 60,000 people. Ukrainian and Scottish Americans numbered 55,000 and 35,000, respectively. People identifying ancestry from Spain numbered 30,838 total in 2010. People of Norwegian and Swedish descent both stood at about 20,000 each, while people of Czech, Lithuanian, Portuguese, Scotch-Irish, and Welsh descent all numbered between 12,000-14,000 people. Arab Americans number over 160,000 in New York City, with the highest concentration in Brooklyn. Central Asians, primarily Uzbek Americans, are a rapidly growing segment of the city's non-Hispanic white population, enumerating over 30,000, and including over half of all Central Asian immigrants to the United States, most settling in Queens or Brooklyn. Albanian Americans are most highly concentrated in the Bronx.The wider New York City metropolitan statistical area, with over 20 million people, about 50% greater than the second-place Los Angeles metropolitan area in the United States, is also ethnically diverse, with the largest foreign-born population of any metropolitan region in the world. The New York region continues to be by far the leading metropolitan gateway for legal immigrants admitted into the United States, substantially exceeding the combined totals of Los Angeles and Miami. It is home to the largest Jewish and Israeli communities outside Israel, with the Jewish population in the region numbering over 1.5 million in 2012 and including many diverse Jewish sects predominantly from around the Middle East and Eastern Europe. The metropolitan area is also home to 20% of the nation's Indian Americans and at least 20 Little India enclaves, and 15% of all Korean Americans and four Koreatowns; the largest Asian Indian population in the Western Hemisphere; the largest Russian American, Italian American, and African American populations; the largest Dominican American, Puerto Rican American, and South American and second-largest overall Hispanic population in the United States, numbering 4.8 million; and includes multiple established Chinatowns within New York City alone.Ecuador, Colombia, Guyana, Peru, and Brazil were the top source countries from South America for legal immigrants to the New York City region in 2013; the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, Haiti, and Trinidad and Tobago in the Caribbean; Egypt, Ghana, and Nigeria from Africa; and El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala in Central America. Amidst a resurgence of Puerto Rican migration to New York City, this population had increased to approximately 1.3 million in the metropolitan area as of  2013.\\n\\n\\n=== Sexual orientation and gender identity ===\\n\\nThe New York metropolitan area is home to a prominent self-identifying gay and bisexual community estimated at nearly 570,000 individuals, the largest in the United States and one of the world's largest. Same-sex marriages in New York were legalized on June 24, 2011 and were authorized to take place beginning 30 days thereafter. Charles Kaiser, author of The Gay Metropolis: The Landmark History of Gay Life in America, wrote that in the era after World War II, \\\"New York City became the literal gay metropolis for hundreds of thousands of immigrants from within and without the United States: the place they chose to learn how to live openly, honestly and without shame.\\\" The annual New York City Pride March (or gay pride parade) traverses southward down Fifth Avenue and ends at Greenwich Village in Lower Manhattan; the parade rivals the Sao Paulo Gay Pride Parade as the largest pride parade in the world, attracting tens of thousands of participants and millions of sidewalk spectators each June.\\n\\n\\n==== Transgender contribution ====\\nWayne R. Dynes, author of the Encyclopedia of Homosexuality, wrote that drag queens were the only \\\"transgender folks around\\\" during the June 1969 Stonewall riots. \\\"None of them in fact made a major contribution to the movement.\\\" Others say the transgender community in New York City played a significant role in fighting for LGBT equality during the period of the Stonewall riots and thereafter. New York City is home to the largest transgender population in the United States, estimated at 25,000 in 2016. However, until the Stonewall riots, this community had felt marginalized and neglected by the gay community.\\n\\n\\n=== Religion ===\\nChristianity (59%) -- made up of Roman Catholicism (33%), Protestantism (23%), and other Christians (3%) -- is the most prevalent religion in New York, as of  2014. It is followed by Judaism, with approximately 1.1 million adherents, over half of whom live in Brooklyn. The Jewish population makes up 18.4% of the city. Islam ranks third in New York City, with official estimates ranging between 600,000 and 1,000,000 observers, including 10% of the city's public school children. These three largest groups are followed by Hinduism, Buddhism, and a variety of other religions, as well as atheism. In 2014, 24% of New Yorkers self-identified with no organized religious affiliation.\\n\\n\\n=== Wealth and income disparity ===\\nNew York City has a high degree of income disparity as indicated by its Gini Coefficient of 0.5 for the city overall and 0.6 for Manhattan. In the first quarter of 2014, the average weekly wage in New York County (Manhattan) was $2,749, representing the highest total among large counties in the United States. As of 2017, New York City was home to the highest number of billionaires of any city in the world at 103, including former Mayor Michael Bloomberg. New York also had the highest density of millionaires per capita among major U.S. cities in 2014, at 4.6% of residents. New York City is one of the relatively few American cities levying an income tax (currently about 3%) on its residents.\\n\\n\\n== Economy ==\\n\\n\\n=== City economic overview ===\\nNew York is a global hub of business and commerce. The city is a major center for banking and finance, retailing, world trade, transportation, tourism, real estate, new media, traditional media, advertising, legal services, accountancy, insurance, theater, fashion, and the arts in the United States; while Silicon Alley, metonymous for New York's broad-spectrum high technology sphere, continues to expand. The Port of New York and New Jersey is also a major economic engine, handling record cargo volume in the first half of 2014. In February 2017, New York City's unemployment rate fell to 4.3%, the lowest in the city's recorded history, with the city achieving the status of what many economists refer to as full employment.Many Fortune 500 corporations are headquartered in New York City, as are a large number of multinational corporations. One out of ten private sector jobs in the city is with a foreign company. New York City has been ranked first among cities across the globe in attracting capital, business, and tourists. This ability to attract foreign investment helped New York City top the FDi Magazine American Cities of the Future ranking for 2013.Real estate is a major force in the city's economy, as the total value of all New York City property was assessed at US$1.072 trillion for the 2017 fiscal year, an increase of 10.6% from the previous year with 89% of the increase coming from market effects. The Time Warner Center is the property with the highest-listed market value in the city, at US$1.1 billion in 2006. New York City is home to some of the nation's--and the world's--most valuable real estate. 450 Park Avenue was sold on July 2, 2007 for US$510 million, about $1,589 per square foot ($17,104/m2), breaking the barely month-old record for an American office building of $1,476 per square foot ($15,887/m2) set in the June 2007 sale of 660 Madison Avenue. According to Forbes, in 2014, Manhattan was home to six of the top ten ZIP Codes in the United States by median housing price. Fifth Avenue in Midtown Manhattan commands the highest retail rents in the world, at US$3,000 per square foot ($32,000/m2) in 2017.As of  2013, the global advertising agencies of Omnicom Group and Interpublic Group, both based in Manhattan, had combined annual revenues of approximately US$21 billion, reflecting New York City's role as the top global center for the advertising industry, which is metonymously referred to as \\\"Madison Avenue\\\". The city's fashion industry provides approximately 180,000 employees with $11 billion in annual wages.Other important sectors include medical research and technology, non-profit institutions, and universities. Manufacturing accounts for a significant but declining share of employment, although the city's garment industry is showing a resurgence in Brooklyn. Food processing is a US$5 billion industry that employs more than 19,000 residents.\\nChocolate is New York City's leading specialty-food export, with up to US$234 million worth of exports each year. Entrepreneurs were forming a \\\"Chocolate District\\\" in Brooklyn as of  2014, while Godiva, one of the world's largest chocolatiers, continues to be headquartered in Manhattan.\\n\\n\\n=== Wall Street ===\\n\\nNew York City's most important economic sector lies in its role as the headquarters for the U.S. financial industry, metonymously known as Wall Street. The city's securities industry, enumerating 163,400 jobs in August 2013, continues to form the largest segment of the city's financial sector and an important economic engine, accounting in 2012 for 5 percent of the city's private sector jobs, 8.5 percent (US$3.8 billion) of its tax revenue, and 22 percent of the city's total wages, including an average salary of US$360,700. Many large financial companies are headquartered in New York City, and the city is also home to a burgeoning number of financial startup companies.\\nLower Manhattan is home to the New York Stock Exchange, on Wall Street, and the NASDAQ, at 165 Broadway, representing the world's largest and second largest stock exchanges, respectively, when measured both by overall average daily trading volume and by total market capitalization of their listed companies in 2013. Investment banking fees on Wall Street totaled approximately $40 billion in 2012, while in 2013, senior New York City bank officers who manage risk and compliance functions earned as much as $324,000 annually. In fiscal year 2013-14, Wall Street's securities industry generated 19% of New York State's tax revenue. New York City remains the largest global center for trading in public equity and debt capital markets, driven in part by the size and financial development of the U.S. economy. In July 2013, NYSE Euronext, the operator of the New York Stock Exchange, took over the administration of the London interbank offered rate from the British Bankers Association. New York also leads in hedge fund management; private equity; and the monetary volume of mergers and acquisitions. Several investment banks and investment managers headquartered in Manhattan are important participants in other global financial centers. New York is also the principal commercial banking center of the United States.Many of the world's largest media conglomerates are also based in the city. Manhattan contained over 500 million square feet (46.5 million m2) of office space in 2015, making it the largest office market in the United States, while Midtown Manhattan, with nearly 400 million square feet (37.2 million m2) in 2015, is the largest central business district in the world.\\n\\n\\n=== Silicon Alley ===\\n\\nSilicon Alley, centered in Manhattan, has evolved into a metonym for the sphere encompassing the New York City metropolitan region's high technology industries involving the Internet, new media, telecommunications, digital media, software development, biotechnology, game design, financial technology (\\\"FinTech\\\"), and other fields within information technology that are supported by its entrepreneurship ecosystem and venture capital investments. In 2015, Silicon Alley generated over US$7.3 billion in venture capital investment across a broad spectrum of high technology enterprises, most based in Manhattan, with others in Brooklyn, Queens, and elsewhere in the region. High technology startup companies and employment are growing in New York City and the region, bolstered by the city's position in North America as the leading Internet hub and telecommunications center, including its vicinity to several transatlantic fiber optic trunk lines, New York's intellectual capital, and its extensive outdoor wireless connectivity. Verizon Communications, headquartered at 140 West Street in Lower Manhattan, was at the final stages in 2014 of completing a US$3 billion fiberoptic telecommunications upgrade throughout New York City. As of  2014, New York City hosted 300,000 employees in the tech sector.The biotechnology sector is also growing in New York City, based upon the city's strength in academic scientific research and public and commercial financial support. On December 19, 2011, then Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg announced his choice of Cornell University and Technion-Israel Institute of Technology to build a US$2 billion graduate school of applied sciences called Cornell Tech on Roosevelt Island with the goal of transforming New York City into the world's premier technology capital. By mid-2014, Accelerator, a biotech investment firm, had raised more than US$30 million from investors, including Eli Lilly and Company, Pfizer, and Johnson & Johnson, for initial funding to create biotechnology startups at the Alexandria Center for Life Science, which encompasses more than 700,000 square feet (65,000 m2) on East 29th Street and promotes collaboration among scientists and entrepreneurs at the center and with nearby academic, medical, and research institutions. The New York City Economic Development Corporation's Early Stage Life Sciences Funding Initiative and venture capital partners, including Celgene, General Electric Ventures, and Eli Lilly, committed a minimum of US$100 million to help launch 15 to 20 ventures in life sciences and biotechnology.\\n\\n\\n=== Tourism ===\\n\\nTourism is a vital industry for New York City, which has witnessed a growing combined volume of international and domestic tourists, receiving an eighth consecutive annual record of approximately 62.8 million visitors in 2017. Tourism had generated an all-time high US$61.3 billion in overall economic impact for New York City in 2014, pending 2015 statistics. Approximately 12 million visitors to New York City were from outside the United States, with the highest numbers from the United Kingdom, Canada, Brazil, and China.\\nI Love New York (stylized I  NY) is both a logo and a song that are the basis of an advertising campaign and have been used since 1977 to promote tourism in New York City, and later to promote New York State as well. The trademarked logo, owned by New York State Empire State Development, appears in souvenir shops and brochures throughout the city and state, some licensed, many not. The song is the state song of New York.\\nMajor tourist destinations include Times Square; Broadway theater productions; the Empire State Building; the Statue of Liberty; Ellis Island; the United Nations Headquarters; museums such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art; greenspaces such as Central Park and Washington Square Park; Rockefeller Center; the Manhattan Chinatown; luxury shopping along Fifth and Madison Avenues; and events such as the Halloween Parade in Greenwich Village; the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade; the lighting of the Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree; the St. Patrick's Day parade; seasonal activities such as ice skating in Central Park in the wintertime; the Tribeca Film Festival; and free performances in Central Park at Summerstage.

Two of the three national daily newspapers in the United States are New York papers: The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times, which has won the most Pulitzer Prizes for journalism. Major tabloid newspapers in the city include: The New York Daily News, which was founded in 1919 by Joseph Medill Patterson and The New York Post, founded in 1801 by Alexander Hamilton. The city also has a comprehensive ethnic press, with 270 newspapers and magazines published in more than 40 languages. El Diario La Prensa is New York's largest Spanish-language daily and the oldest in the nation. The New York Amsterdam News, published in Harlem, is a prominent African American newspaper. The Village Voice, historically the largest alternative newspaper in the United States, announced in 2017 that it would cease publication of its print edition and convert to a fully digital venture.The television and radio industry developed in New York and is a significant employer in the city's economy. The three major American broadcast networks are all headquartered in New York: ABC, CBS, and NBC. Many cable networks are based in the city as well, including MTV, Fox News, HBO, Showtime, Bravo, Food Network, AMC, and Comedy Central. The City of New York operates a public broadcast service, NYC Media, that has produced several original Emmy Award-winning shows covering music and culture in city neighborhoods and city government. WBAI, with news and information programming, is one of the few socialist radio stations operating in the United States.\\nNew York is also a major center for non-commercial educational media. The oldest public-access television channel in the United States is the Manhattan Neighborhood Network, founded in 1971. WNET is the city's major public television station and a primary source of national Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) television programming. WNYC, a public radio station owned by the city until 1997, has the largest public radio audience in the United States.\\n\\n\\n== Education and scholarly activity ==\\n\\n\\n=== Primary and secondary education ===\\nThe New York City Public Schools system, managed by the New York City Department of Education, is the largest public school system in the United States, serving about 1.1 million students in more than 1,700 separate primary and secondary schools. The city's public school system includes nine specialized high schools to serve academically and artistically gifted students.

There are approximately 900 additional privately run secular and religious schools in the city.\\n\\n\\n=== Higher education and research ===\\nOver 600,000 students are enrolled in New York City's over 120 higher education institutions, the highest number of any city in the United States and higher than other major global cities like London and Tokyo, including over half million in the City University of New York (CUNY) system alone in 2014. In 2005, three out of five Manhattan residents were college graduates, and one out of four had a postgraduate degree, forming one of the highest concentrations of highly educated people in any American city. New York City is home to such notable private universities as Barnard College, Columbia University, Cooper Union, Fordham University, Mercy College, New York University, New York Institute of Technology, Pace University, Rockefeller University, and Yeshiva University; several of these universities are ranked among the top universities in the world. The public CUNY system is one of the largest universities in the nation, comprising 24 institutions across all five boroughs: senior colleges, community colleges, and other graduate/professional schools. The public State University of New York (SUNY) system serves New York City, as well as the rest of the state.

The graduates of SUNY Maritime College in the Bronx earned the highest average annual salary of any university graduates in the United States, US$144,000 as of 2017.\\n\\n\\n== Human resources ==\\n\\n\\n=== Public health ===\\n\\nThe New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation (HHC) operates the public hospitals and clinics in New York City. A public benefit corporation with $6.7 billion in annual revenues, HHC is the largest municipal healthcare system in the United States serving 1.4 million patients, including more than 475,000 uninsured city residents. HHC was created in 1969 by the New York State Legislature as a public benefit corporation (Chapter 1016 of the Laws 1969). HHC operates 11 acute care hospitals, five nursing homes, six diagnostic and treatment centers, and more than 70 community-based primary care sites, serving primarily the poor and working class. HHC's MetroPlus Health Plan is one of the New York area's largest providers of government-sponsored health insurance and is the plan of choice for nearly half million New Yorkers.HHC's facilities annually provide millions of New Yorkers services interpreted in more than 190 languages. The most well-known hospital in the HHC system is Bellevue Hospital, the oldest public hospital in the United States. Bellevue is the designated hospital for treatment of the President of the United States and other world leaders if they become sick or injured while in New York City. The president of HHC is Ramanathan Raju, MD, a surgeon and former CEO of the Cook County health system in Illinois. In August 2017, Mayor Bill de Blasio signed legislation outlawing pharmacies from selling cigarettes once their existing licenses to do so expired, beginning in 2018.\\n\\n\\n=== Public safety ===\\n\\n\\n==== Police and law enforcement ====\\n\\nThe New York City Police Department (NYPD) has been the largest police force in the United States by a significant margin, with over 35,000 sworn officers. Members of the NYPD are frequently referred to by politicians, the media, and their own police cars by the nickname, New York's Finest.\\nCrime has continued an overall downward trend in New York City since the 1990s. In 2012, the NYPD came under scrutiny for its use of a stop-and-frisk program, which has undergone several policy revisions since then. In 2014, New York City had the third lowest murder rate among the largest U.S. cities, having become significantly safer after a spike in crime in the 1970s through 1990s. Violent crime in New York City decreased more than 75% from 1993 to 2005, and continued decreasing during periods when the nation as a whole saw increases. By 2002, New York City's crime rate was similar to that of Provo, Utah, and was ranked 197th in crime among the 216 U.S. cities with populations greater than 100,000. In 2005, the homicide rate was at its lowest level since 1966, and in 2007, the city recorded fewer than 500 homicides for the first time ever since crime statistics were first published in 1963. In 2015, 50.5% of New York City misdemeanor assault suspects were black, 33.3% Hispanic, 11.1% white, 4.8% Asian/Pacific Islander and 0.3% Native American. New York City experienced 352 homicides in 2015, its second lowest number on record. In 2016 the murder rate fell to 3.9 per 100,000 residents, significantly below the US average of 5.3, and was projected to drop significantly in 2017.Sociologists and criminologists have not reached consensus on the explanation for the dramatic decrease in the city's crime rate. Some attribute the phenomenon to new tactics used by the NYPD, including its use of CompStat and the broken windows theory. Others cite the end of the crack epidemic and demographic changes, including from immigration. Another theory is that widespread exposure to lead pollution from automobile exhaust, which can lower intelligence and increase aggression levels, incited the initial crime wave in the mid-20th century, most acutely affecting heavily trafficked cities like New York. A strong correlation was found demonstrating that violent crime rates in New York and other big cities began to fall after lead was removed from American gasoline in the 1970s. Another theory cited to explain New York City's falling homicide rate is the inverse correlation between the number of murders and the increasingly wetter climate in the city.Organized crime has long been associated with New York City, beginning with the Forty Thieves and the Roach Guards in the Five Points in the 1820s. The 20th century saw a rise in the Mafia, dominated by the Five Families, as well as in gangs, including the Black Spades. The Mafia and gang presence has declined in the city in the 21st century.\\n\\n\\n==== Firefighting ====\\n\\nThe New York City Fire Department (FDNY), provides fire protection, technical rescue, primary response to biological, chemical, and radioactive hazards, and emergency medical services for the five boroughs of New York City. The New York City Fire Department is the largest municipal fire department in the United States and the second largest in the world after the Tokyo Fire Department. The FDNY employs approximately 11,080 uniformed firefighters and over 3,300 uniformed EMTs and paramedics. The FDNY's motto is New York's Bravest.\\nThe New York City Fire Department faces multifaceted firefighting challenges in many ways unique to New York. In addition to responding to building types that range from wood-frame single family homes to high-rise structures, there are many secluded bridges and tunnels, as well as large parks and wooded areas that can give rise to brush fires. New York is also home to one of the largest subway systems in the world, consisting of hundreds of miles of tunnel with electrified track.\\nThe FDNY headquarters is located at 9 MetroTech Center in Downtown Brooklyn, and the FDNY Fire Academy is located on Randalls Island. There are three Bureau of Fire Communications alarm offices which receive and dispatch alarms to appropriate units. One office, at 11 Metrotech Center in Brooklyn, houses Manhattan/Citywide, Brooklyn, and Staten Island Fire Communications. The Bronx and Queens offices are in separate buildings.\\n\\n\\n=== Public library system ===\\n\\nThe New York Public Library, which has the largest collection of any public library system in the United States, serves Manhattan, the Bronx, and Staten Island. Queens is served by the Queens Borough Public Library, the nation's second largest public library system, while the Brooklyn Public Library serves Brooklyn.\\n\\n\\n== Culture and contemporary life ==\\n\\nNew York City has been described as the cultural capital of the world by the diplomatic consulates of Iceland and Latvia and by New York's Baruch College. A book containing a series of essays titled New York, Culture Capital of the World, 1940-1965 has also been published as showcased by the National Library of Australia. In describing New York, author Tom Wolfe said, \\\"Culture just seems to be in the air, like part of the weather.\\\"Numerous major American cultural movements began in the city, such as the Harlem Renaissance, which established the African-American literary canon in the United States. The city was a center of jazz in the 1940s, abstract expressionism in the 1950s, and the birthplace of hip hop in the 1970s. The city's punk and hardcore scenes were influential in the 1970s and 1980s. New York has long had a flourishing scene for Jewish American literature.\\nThe city is the birthplace of many cultural movements, including the Harlem Renaissance in literature and visual art; abstract expressionism (also known as the New York School) in painting; and hip hop, punk, salsa, freestyle, Tin Pan Alley, certain forms of jazz, and (along with Philadelphia) disco in music. New York City has been considered the dance capital of the world. The city is also frequently the setting for novels, movies (see List of films set in New York City), and television programs. New York Fashion Week is one of the world's preeminent fashion events and is afforded extensive coverage by the media.\\nNew York has also frequently been ranked the top fashion capital of the world on the annual list compiled by the Global Language Monitor.\\n\\n\\n=== Arts ===\\nNew York City has more than 2,000 arts and cultural organizations and more than 500 art galleries of all sizes. The city government funds the arts with a larger annual budget than the National Endowment for the Arts. Wealthy business magnates in the 19th century built a network of major cultural institutions, such as the famed Carnegie Hall and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, that would become internationally established. The advent of electric lighting led to elaborate theater productions, and in the 1880s, New York City theaters on Broadway and along 42nd Street began featuring a new stage form that became known as the Broadway musical. Strongly influenced by the city's immigrants, productions such as those of Harrigan and Hart, George M. Cohan, and others used song in narratives that often reflected themes of hope and ambition. New York City itself is the subject or background of many plays and musicals.\\n\\n\\n==== Performing arts ====\\n\\nBroadway theatre is one of the premier forms of English-language theatre in the world, named after Broadway, the major thoroughfare that crosses Times Square, also sometimes referred to as \\\"The Great White Way\\\". Forty-one venues in Midtown Manhattan's Theatre District, each with at least 500 seats, are classified as Broadway theatres. According to The Broadway League, Broadway shows sold approximately US$1.27 billion worth of tickets in the 2013-2014 season, an 11.4% increase from US$1.139 billion in the 2012-2013 season. Attendance in 2013-2014 stood at 12.21 million, representing a 5.5% increase from the 2012-2013 season's 11.57 million. Performance artists displaying diverse skills are ubiquitous on the streets of Manhattan.\\nLincoln Center for the Performing Arts, anchoring Lincoln Square on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, is home to numerous influential arts organizations, including the Metropolitan Opera, New York City Opera, New York Philharmonic, and New York City Ballet, as well as the Vivian Beaumont Theater, the Juilliard School, Jazz at Lincoln Center, and Alice Tully Hall. The Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute is in Union Square, and Tisch School of the Arts is based at New York University, while Central Park SummerStage presents free music concerts in Central Park.\\n\\n\\n==== Visual arts ====\\n\\nNew York City is home to hundreds of cultural institutions and historic sites, many of which are internationally known.\\nMuseum Mile is the name for a section of Fifth Avenue running from 82nd to 105th streets on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, in an area sometimes called Upper Carnegie Hill. The Mile, which contains one of the densest displays of culture in the world, is actually three blocks longer than one mile (1.6 km). Ten museums occupy the length of this section of Fifth Avenue. The tenth museum, the Museum for African Art, joined the ensemble in 2009, although its museum at 110th Street, the first new museum constructed on the Mile since the Guggenheim in 1959, opened in late 2012. In addition to other programming, the museums collaborate for the annual Museum Mile Festival, held each year in June, to promote the museums and increase visitation. Many of the world's most lucrative art auctions are held in New York City.\\n\\n\\n=== Cuisine ===\\n\\nNew York City's food culture includes an array of international cuisines influenced by the city's immigrant history. Central and Eastern European immigrants, especially Jewish immigrants from those regions, brought bagels, cheesecake, hot dogs, knishes, and delicatessens (or delis) to the city. Italian immigrants brought New York-style pizza and Italian cuisine into the city, while Jewish immigrants and Irish immigrants brought pastrami and corned beef, respectively. Chinese and other Asian restaurants, sandwich joints, trattorias, diners, and coffeehouses are ubiquitous throughout the city. Some 4,000 mobile food vendors licensed by the city, many immigrant-owned, have made Middle Eastern foods such as falafel and kebabs examples of modern New York street food. The city is home to \\\"nearly one thousand of the finest and most diverse haute cuisine restaurants in the world\\\", according to Michelin. The New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene assigns letter grades to the city's 24,000 restaurants based upon their inspection results.\\n\\n\\n=== Parades ===\\nNew York City is well known for its street parades, which celebrate a broad array of themes, including holidays, nationalities, human rights, and major league sports team championship victories. The majority of parades are held in Manhattan. The primary orientation of the annual street parades is typically from north to south, marching along major avenues. The annual Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade is the world's largest parade, beginning alongside Central Park and processing southward to the flagship Macy's Herald Square store; the parade is viewed on telecasts worldwide and draws millions of spectators in person. Other notable parades including the annual St. Patrick's Day Parade in March, the LGBT Pride March in June, the Greenwich Village Halloween Parade in October, and numerous parades commemorating the independence days of many nations. Ticker-tape parades celebrating championships won by sports teams as well as other heroic accomplishments march northward along the Canyon of Heroes on Broadway from Bowling Green to City Hall Park in Lower Manhattan.\\n\\n\\n=== Accent and dialect ===\\n\\nThe New York area is home to a distinctive regional speech pattern called the New York dialect, alternatively known as Brooklynese or New Yorkese. It has generally been considered one of the most recognizable accents within American English.The traditional New York area accent is characterized as non-rhotic, so that the sound [r] does not appear at the end of a syllable or immediately before a consonant; therefore the pronunciation of the city name as \\\"New Yawk.\\\" There is no [r] in words like park [pa@k] or [pa@k] (with vowel backed and diphthongized due to the low-back chain shift), butter [b^r@], or here [hi@]. In another feature called the low back chain shift, the [o] vowel sound of words like talk, law, cross, chocolate, and coffee and the often homophonous [or] in core and more are tensed and usually raised more than in General American English. In the most old-fashioned and extreme versions of the New York dialect, the vowel sounds of words like \\\"girl\\\" and of words like \\\"oil\\\" became a diphthong [eI]. This is often misperceived by speakers of other accents as a reversal of the er and oy sounds, so that girl is pronounced \\\"goil\\\" and oil is pronounced \\\"erl\\\"; this leads to the caricature of New Yorkers saying things like \\\"Joizey\\\" (Jersey), \\\"Toidy-Toid Street\\\" (33rd St.) and \\\"terlet\\\" (toilet). The character Archie Bunker from the 1970s sitcom All in the Family (played by Carroll O'Connor) was an example of having used this pattern of speech.\\nThe classic version of the New York City dialect is generally centered on middle and working-class New Yorkers. The influx of non-European immigrants in recent decades has led to changes in this distinctive dialect, and the traditional form of this speech pattern is no longer as prevalent among general New Yorkers as it has been in the past.\\n\\n\\n=== Sports ===\\n\\nNew York City is home to the headquarters of the National Football League, Major League Baseball, the National Basketball Association, the National Hockey League, and Major League Soccer. The New York metropolitan area hosts the most sports teams in these five professional leagues. Participation in professional sports in the city predates all professional leagues, and the city has been continuously hosting professional sports since the birth of the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1882. The city has played host to over forty major professional teams in the five sports and their respective competing leagues, both current and historic. Four of the ten most expensive stadiums ever built worldwide (MetLife Stadium, the new Yankee Stadium, Madison Square Garden, and Citi Field) are located in the New York metropolitan area. Madison Square Garden, its predecessor, the original Yankee Stadium and Ebbets Field, are sporting venues located in New York City, the latter two having been commemorated on U.S. postage stamps.\\nNew York has been described as the \\\"Capital of Baseball\\\". There have been 35 Major League Baseball World Series and 73 pennants won by New York teams. It is one of only five metro areas (Los Angeles, Chicago, Baltimore-Washington, and the San Francisco Bay Area being the others) to have two baseball teams. Additionally, there have been 14 World Series in which two New York City teams played each other, known as a Subway Series and occurring most recently in 2000. No other metropolitan area has had this happen more than once (Chicago in 1906, St. Louis in 1944, and the San Francisco Bay Area in 1989). The city's two current Major League Baseball teams are the New York Mets, who play at Citi Field in Queens, and the New York Yankees, who play at Yankee Stadium in the Bronx. These teams compete in six games of interleague play every regular season that has also come to be called the Subway Series. The Yankees have won a record 27 championships, while the Mets have won the World Series twice. The city also was once home to the Brooklyn Dodgers (now the Los Angeles Dodgers), who won the World Series once, and the New York Giants (now the San Francisco Giants), who won the World Series five times. Both teams moved to California in 1958. There are also two Minor League Baseball teams in the city, the Brooklyn Cyclones and Staten Island Yankees.The city is represented in the National Football League by the New York Giants and the New York Jets, although both teams play their home games at MetLife Stadium in nearby East Rutherford, New Jersey, which hosted Super Bowl XLVIII in 2014.The metropolitan area is home to three National Hockey League teams. The New York Rangers, the traditional representative of the city itself and one of the league's Original Six, play at Madison Square Garden in Manhattan. The New York Islanders, traditionally representing Nassau and Suffolk Counties of Long Island, currently play at Barclays Center in Brooklyn and are planning a return to Nassau County by way of a new arena just outside the border with Queens at Belmont Park. The New Jersey Devils play at Prudential Center in nearby Newark, New Jersey and traditionally represent the counties of neighboring New Jersey which are coextensive with the boundaries of the New York metropolitan area and media market.\\nThe city's National Basketball Association teams are the Brooklyn Nets and the New York Knicks, while the New York Liberty is the city's Women's National Basketball Association team. The first national college-level basketball championship, the National Invitation Tournament, was held in New York in 1938 and remains in the city. The city is well known for its links to basketball, which is played in nearly every park in the city by local youth, many of whom have gone on to play for major college programs and in the NBA.\\nIn soccer, New York City is represented by New York City FC of Major League Soccer, who play their home games at Yankee Stadium and the New York Red Bulls, who play their home games at Red Bull Arena in nearby Harrison, New Jersey. Historically, the city is known for the New York Cosmos, the highly successful former professional soccer team which was the American home of Pele. A new version of the New York Cosmos was formed in 2010, and began play in the second division North American Soccer League in 2013. The Cosmos play their home games at James M. Shuart Stadium on the campus of Hofstra University, just outside the New York City limits in Hempstead, New York.\\nThe annual United States Open Tennis Championships is one of the world's four Grand Slam tennis tournaments and is held at the National Tennis Center in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, Queens. The New York City Marathon, which courses through all five boroughs, is the world's largest running marathon, with 51,394 finishers in 2016 and 98,247 applicants for the 2017 race. The Millrose Games is an annual track and field meet whose featured event is the Wanamaker Mile. Boxing is also a prominent part of the city's sporting scene, with events like the Amateur Boxing Golden Gloves being held at Madison Square Garden each year. The city is also considered the host of the Belmont Stakes, the last, longest and oldest of horse racing's Triple Crown races, held just over the city's border at Belmont Park on the first or second Sunday of June. The city also hosted the 1932 U.S. Open golf tournament and the 1930 and 1939 PGA Championships, and has been host city for both events several times, most notably for nearby Winged Foot Golf Club. The Gaelic games are played in Riverdale, Bronx at Gaelic Park, home to the New York GAA, the only North American team to compete at the senior inter-county level.\\n\\n\\n== Transportation ==\\n\\nNew York City's comprehensive transportation system is both complex and extensive.\\n\\n\\n=== Rapid transit ===\\nMass transit in New York City, most of which runs 24 hours a day, accounts for one in every three users of mass transit in the United States, and two-thirds of the nation's rail riders live in the New York City Metropolitan Area.\\n\\n\\n==== Rail ====\\n\\nThe iconic New York City Subway system is the largest rapid transit system in the world when measured by stations in operation, with 472, and by length of routes. Nearly all of New York's subway system is open 24 hours a day, in contrast to the overnight shutdown common to systems in most cities, including Hong Kong, London, Paris, Seoul, and Tokyo. The New York City Subway is also the busiest metropolitan rail transit system in the Western Hemisphere, with 1.76 billion passenger rides in 2015, while Grand Central Terminal, also referred to as \\\"Grand Central Station\\\", is the world's largest railway station by number of train platforms.\\nPublic transport is essential in New York City. 54.6% of New Yorkers commuted to work in 2005 using mass transit. This is in contrast to the rest of the United States, where 91% of commuters travel in automobiles to their workplace. According to the New York City Comptroller, workers in the New York City area spend an average of 6 hours and 18 minutes getting to work each week, the longest commute time in the nation among large cities. New York is the only US city in which a majority (52%) of households do not have a car; only 22% of Manhattanites own a car. Due to their high usage of mass transit, New Yorkers spend less of their household income on transportation than the national average, saving $19 billion annually on transportation compared to other urban Americans.New York City's commuter rail network is the largest in North America. The rail network, connecting New York City to its suburbs, consists of the Long Island Rail Road, Metro-North Railroad, and New Jersey Transit. The combined systems converge at Grand Central Terminal and Pennsylvania Station and contain more than 250 stations and 20 rail lines. In Queens, the elevated AirTrain people mover system connects JFK International Airport to the New York City Subway and the Long Island Rail Road; a separate AirTrain system is planned alongside the Grand Central Parkway to connect LaGuardia Airport to these transit systems. For intercity rail, New York City is served by Amtrak, whose busiest station by a significant margin is Pennsylvania Station on the West Side of Manhattan, from which Amtrak provides connections to Boston, Philadelphia, and Washington, D.C. along the Northeast Corridor, and long-distance train service to other North American cities.The Staten Island Railway rapid transit system solely serves Staten Island, operating 24 hours a day. The Port Authority Trans-Hudson (PATH train) links Midtown and Lower Manhattan to northeastern New Jersey, primarily Hoboken, Jersey City, and Newark. Like the New York City Subway, the PATH operates 24 hours a day; meaning three of the six rapid transit systems in the world which operate on 24-hour schedules are wholly or partly in New York (the others are a portion of the Chicago 'L', the PATCO Speedline serving Philadelphia, and the Copenhagen Metro).\\nMultibillion-dollar heavy rail transit projects under construction in New York City include the Second Avenue Subway, the East Side Access project, and the 7 Subway Extension.\\n\\n\\n==== Buses ====\\n\\nNew York City's public bus fleet is the largest in North America, and the Port Authority Bus Terminal, the main intercity bus terminal of the city, serves 7,000 buses and 200,000 commuters daily, making it the busiest bus station in the world.\\n\\n\\n=== Air ===\\n\\nNew York's airspace is the busiest in the United States and one of the world's busiest air transportation corridors. The three busiest airports in the New York metropolitan area include John F. Kennedy International Airport, Newark Liberty International Airport, and LaGuardia Airport; 130.5 million travelers used these three airports in 2016, and the city's airspace is the busiest in the nation. JFK and Newark Liberty were the busiest and fourth busiest U.S. gateways for international air passengers, respectively, in 2012; as of  2011, JFK was the busiest airport for international passengers in North America. Plans have advanced to expand passenger volume at a fourth airport, Stewart International Airport near Newburgh, New York, by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Plans were announced in July 2015 to entirely rebuild LaGuardia Airport in a multibillion-dollar project to replace its aging facilities. Other commercial airports in or serving the New York metropolitan area include Long Island MacArthur Airport, Trenton-Mercer Airport and Westchester County Airport. The primary general aviation airport serving the area is Teterboro Airport.\\n\\n\\n=== Ferries ===\\n\\nThe Staten Island Ferry is the world's busiest ferry route, carrying over 23 million passengers from July 2015 through June 2016 on the 5.2-mile (8.4 km) route between Staten Island and Lower Manhattan and running 24 hours a day. Other ferry systems shuttle commuters between Manhattan and other locales within the city and the metropolitan area.\\nNYC Ferry, a NYCEDC initiative with routes planned to travel to all five boroughs, was launched in 2017, with second graders choosing the names of the ferries. Meanwhile, Seastreak ferry announced construction of a 600-passenger high-speed luxury ferry in September 2016, to shuttle riders between the Jersey Shore and Manhattan, anticipated to start service in 2017; this would be the largest vessel in its class.\\n\\n\\n=== Taxis, transport startups, and trams ===\\nOther features of the city's transportation infrastructure encompass more than 12,000 yellow taxicabs; various competing startup transportation network companies; and an aerial tramway that transports commuters between Roosevelt Island and Manhattan Island. Ride-sharing services have become significant competition for cab drivers in New York.\\n\\n\\n=== Streets and highways ===\\n\\nDespite New York's heavy reliance on its vast public transit system, streets are a defining feature of the city. Manhattan's street grid plan greatly influenced the city's physical development. Several of the city's streets and avenues, like Broadway, Wall Street, Madison Avenue, and Seventh Avenue are also used as metonyms for national industries there: the theater, finance, advertising, and fashion organizations, respectively.\\nNew York City also has an extensive web of expressways and parkways, which link the city's boroughs to each other and to northern New Jersey, Westchester County, Long Island, and southwestern Connecticut through various bridges and tunnels. Because these highways serve millions of outer borough and suburban residents who commute into Manhattan, it is quite common for motorists to be stranded for hours in traffic jams that are a daily occurrence, particularly during rush hour.New York City is also known for its rules regarding turning at red lights. Unlike the rest of the United States, New York State prohibits right or left turns on red in cities with a population greater than one million, to reduce traffic collisions and increase pedestrian safety. In New York City, therefore, all turns at red lights are illegal unless a sign permitting such maneuvers is present.\\n\\n\\n==== River crossings ====\\n\\nNew York City is located on one of the world's largest natural harbors, and the boroughs of Manhattan and Staten Island are (primarily) coterminous with islands of the same names, while Queens and Brooklyn are located at the west end of the larger Long Island, and The Bronx is located at the southern tip of New York State's mainland. This situation of boroughs separated by water led to the development of an extensive infrastructure of well-known bridges and tunnels.\\nThe George Washington Bridge is the world's busiest motor vehicle bridge, connecting Manhattan to Bergen County, New Jersey. The Verrazano-Narrows Bridge is the longest suspension bridge in the Americas and one of the world's longest. The Brooklyn Bridge is an icon of the city itself. The towers of the Brooklyn Bridge are built of limestone, granite, and Rosendale cement, and their architectural style is neo-Gothic, with characteristic pointed arches above the passageways through the stone towers. This bridge was also the longest suspension bridge in the world from its opening until 1903, and is the first steel-wire suspension bridge. The Queensboro Bridge is an important piece of cantilever architecture. The Manhattan Bridge, opened in 1909, is considered to be the forerunner of modern suspension bridges, and its design served as the model for many of the long-span suspension bridges around the world; the Manhattan Bridge, Throgs Neck Bridge, Triborough Bridge, and Verrazano-Narrows Bridge are all examples of Structural Expressionism.Manhattan Island is linked to New York City's outer boroughs and New Jersey by several tunnels as well. The Lincoln Tunnel, which carries 120,000 vehicles a day under the Hudson River between New Jersey and Midtown Manhattan, is the busiest vehicular tunnel in the world. The tunnel was built instead of a bridge to allow unfettered passage of large passenger and cargo ships that sailed through New York Harbor and up the Hudson River to Manhattan's piers. The Holland Tunnel, connecting Lower Manhattan to Jersey City, New Jersey, was the world's first mechanically ventilated vehicular tunnel when it opened in 1927. The Queens-Midtown Tunnel, built to relieve congestion on the bridges connecting Manhattan with Queens and Brooklyn, was the largest non-federal project in its time when it was completed in 1940. President Franklin D. Roosevelt was the first person to drive through it. The Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel (officially known as the Hugh L. Carey Tunnel) runs underneath Battery Park and connects the Financial District at the southern tip of Manhattan to Red Hook in Brooklyn.\\n\\n\\n== Environment ==\\n\\n\\n=== Environmental impact reduction ===\\nNew York City has focused on reducing its environmental impact and carbon footprint. Mass transit use in New York City is the highest in the United States. Also, by 2010, the city had 3,715 hybrid taxis and other clean diesel vehicles, representing around 28% of New York's taxi fleet in service, the most of any city in North America.New York's high rate of public transit use, over 200,000 daily cyclists as of  2014, and many pedestrian commuters make it the most energy-efficient major city in the United States. Walk and bicycle modes of travel account for 21% of all modes for trips in the city; nationally the rate for metro regions is about 8%. In both its 2011 and 2015 rankings, Walk Score named New York City the most walkable large city in the United States, and in 2018, Stacker ranked New York the most walkable U.S. city. Citibank sponsored the introduction of 10,000 public bicycles for the city's bike-share project in the summer of 2013. Research conducted by Quinnipiac University showed that a majority of New Yorkers support the initiative. New York City's numerical \\\"in-season cycling indicator\\\" of bicycling in the city hit an all-time high in 2013.The city government was a petitioner in the landmark Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency Supreme Court case forcing the EPA to regulate greenhouse gases as pollutants. The city is a leader in the construction of energy-efficient green office buildings, including the Hearst Tower among others. Mayor Bill de Blasio has committed to an 80% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions between 2014 and 2050 to reduce the city's contributions to climate change, beginning with a comprehensive \\\"Green Buildings\\\" plan.\\n\\n\\n=== Water purity and availability ===\\n\\nNew York City is supplied with drinking water by the protected Catskill Mountains watershed. As a result of the watershed's integrity and undisturbed natural water filtration system, New York is one of only four major cities in the United States the majority of whose drinking water is pure enough not to require purification by water treatment plants. The city's municipal water system is the largest in the United States, moving over one billion gallons of water per day. The Croton Watershed north of the city is undergoing construction of a US$3.2 billion water purification plant to augment New York City's water supply by an estimated 290 million gallons daily, representing a greater than 20% addition to the city's current availability of water. The ongoing expansion of New York City Water Tunnel No. 3, an integral part of the New York City water supply system, is the largest capital construction project in the city's history, with segments serving Manhattan and The Bronx completed, and with segments serving Brooklyn and Queens planned for construction in 2020. In 2018, New York City announced a US$1 billion investment to protect the integrity of its water system and to maintain the purity of its unfiltered water supply.\\n\\n\\n=== Environmental revitalization ===\\nNewtown Creek, a 3.5-mile (6-kilometer) a long estuary that forms part of the border between the boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens, has been designated a Superfund site for environmental clean-up and remediation of the waterway's recreational and economic resources for many communities. One of the most heavily used bodies of water in the Port of New York and New Jersey, it had been one of the most contaminated industrial sites in the country, containing years of discarded toxins, an estimated 30 million US gallons (110,000 m3) of spilled oil, including the Greenpoint oil spill, raw sewage from New York City's sewer system, and other accumulation.\\n\\n\\n== Government and politics ==\\n\\n\\n=== Government ===\\n\\nNew York City has been a metropolitan municipality with a mayor-council form of government since its consolidation in 1898. In New York City, the city government is responsible for public education, correctional institutions, public safety, recreational facilities, sanitation, water supply, and welfare services.\\nThe Mayor and council members are elected to four-year terms. The City Council is a unicameral body consisting of 51 council members whose districts are defined by geographic population boundaries. Each term for the mayor and council members lasts four years and has a three consecutive-term limit, which is reset after a four-year break. The New York City Administrative Code, the New York City Rules, and the City Record are the code of local laws, compilation of regulations, and official journal, respectively.\\n\\nEach borough is coextensive with a judicial district of the state Unified Court System, of which the Criminal Court and the Civil Court are the local courts, while the New York Supreme Court conducts major trials and appeals. Manhattan hosts the First Department of the Supreme Court, Appellate Division while Brooklyn hosts the Second Department. There are also several extrajudicial administrative courts, which are executive agencies and not part of the state Unified Court System.\\nUniquely among major American cities, New York is divided between, and is host to the main branches of, two different US district courts: the District Court for the Southern District of New York, whose main courthouse is on Foley Square near City Hall in Manhattan and whose jurisdiction includes Manhattan and the Bronx; and the District Court for the Eastern District of New York, whose main courthouse is in Brooklyn and whose jurisdiction includes Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island. The US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and US Court of International Trade are also based in New York, also on Foley Square in Manhattan.\\n\\n\\n=== Politics ===\\n\\nThe present mayor is Bill de Blasio, the first Democrat since 1993. He was elected in 2013 with over 73% of the vote, and assumed office on January 1, 2014.\\nThe Democratic Party holds the majority of public offices. As of April 2016, 69% of registered voters in the city are Democrats and 10% are Republicans. New York City has not been carried by a Republican in a statewide or presidential election since President Calvin Coolidge won the five boroughs in 1924. In 2012, Democrat Barack Obama became the first presidential candidate of any party to receive more than 80% of the overall vote in New York City, sweeping all five boroughs. Party platforms center on affordable housing, education, and economic development, and labor politics are of importance in the city.\\nNew York is the most important source of political fundraising in the United States, as four of the top five ZIP Codes in the nation for political contributions are in Manhattan. The top ZIP Code, 10021 on the Upper East Side, generated the most money for the 2004 presidential campaigns of George W. Bush and John Kerry. The city has a strong imbalance of payments with the national and state governments. It receives 83 cents in services for every $1 it sends to the federal government in taxes (or annually sends $11.4 billion more than it receives back). City residents and businesses also spent an additional $4.1 billion in the 2009-2010 fiscal year to the state of New York than the city received in return.\\n\\n\\n== Notable people ==\\n\\n\\n== Global outreach ==\\nIn 2006, the Sister City Program of the City of New York, Inc. was restructured and renamed New York City Global Partners. Through this program, New York City has expanded its international outreach to a network of cities worldwide, promoting the exchange of ideas and innovation between their citizenry and policymakers. New York's historic sister cities are denoted below by the year they joined New York City's partnership network.\\n\\n\\n== Notes ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== Further reading ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nOfficial website\\nNYC Go, official tourism website of New York City\\nNew York City at Curlie (based on DMOZ)\\n Geographic data related to New York City at OpenStreetMap.\\nCollections, 145,000 NYC photographs at Museum of the City of New York\\n\\\"The New New York Skyline\\\".

Discogs currently contains over 10 million releases, by over 5 million artists, across over 1 million labels, contributed from over 400,000 contributor user accounts -- with these figures constantly growing as users continually add previously unlisted releases to the site over time.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nThe discogs.com domain name was registered on 30 August 2000, and Discogs itself was launched in November 2000 by programmer, DJ, and music fan Kevin Lewandowski originally as a database of electronic music.He was inspired by the success of community-built sites such as Slashdot, eBay, and Open Directory Project, and decided to use this model for a music discography database.The site's original goal was to build the most comprehensive database of electronic music, organized around the artists, labels, and releases available in that genre. In 2003 the Discogs system was completely rewritten, and in January 2004 it began to support other genres, starting with hip hop. Since then, it has expanded to include rock and jazz in January 2005 and funk/soul, Latin, and reggae in October of the same year. In January 2006 blues and non-music (e.g. comedy records, field recordings, interviews) were added. Classical music started being supported in June 2007, and in October 2007 the \\\"final genres were turned on\\\" - adding support for the Stage & Screen, Brass & Military, Children's, and Folk, World, & Country music genres, allowing capture of virtually every single type of audio recording that has ever been released.\\nOn 30 June 2004, Discogs published a report, which included information about the number of its contributors. This report claimed that Discogs had 15,788 contributors and 260,789 releases.On 20 July 2007 a new system for sellers was introduced on the site called Market Price History. It made information available to users who paid for a subscription - though 60 days information was free - access to the past price items were sold for up to 12 months ago by previous sellers who had sold exactly the same release. At the same time, the US$12 per year charge for advanced subscriptions was abolished, as it was felt that the extra features should be made available to all subscribers now that a better, some may say fairer, revenue stream had been found from sellers and purchasers. However, at the beginning of 2008, the Market Price History was also made free of charge for all users, still giving up to a 12-month view of historical sales data for any release.\\n\\n\\n== Milestones ==\\nDiscogs publishes information indicating the number of releases, labels, and artists presently in its database, along with its contributors:\\n\\n\\n== Other projects ==\\nDiscogs has so far created a further six online databases, for collating information on related topics.\\n\\n\\n=== VinylHub ===\\nIn mid 2014, a side project website called VinylHub was started, in order for users to add record shops and stores from around the world, with information concerning location, contact details, what type of items they stocked, et al.\\n\\n\\n=== Filmogs ===\\nIn late 2014, the company released a new beta website called Filmogs. Users can add their physical film collections (on DVD, Blu-ray, LaserDisc, or any other type of physical film release) to the database, and buy and sell film releases in the global marketplace.\\n\\n\\n=== Gearogs ===\\nGearogs was launched as a beta in late 2014, at the same time as Filmogs. The site lets users add and track music equipment, including items such as synths, drum machines, sequencers, samplers, audio software, and any other electronic music making equipment.\\n\\n\\n=== Bookogs ===\\nAt the start of 2015, the company began Bibliogs as another beta project. Users can submit information about their books, physical or electronic, different versions and editions, and also connect different credits (writers, illustrators, translators, publishers, etc.) to these books. 21,000 books were submitted by the end of 2016. The project was in beta phase until 15 August 2017 when it reached more than 31,000 book titles, and rebranded without clear explanation to Bookogs.com, obviously because of legal issues with the old name Bibliogs, and removed 'Beta state' notice from the main page. The next day the 'Marketplace Beta' feature was presented.\\n\\n\\n=== Comicogs ===\\nComicogs launched around the same time as Bookogs, as a means for comic collectors and enthusiasts to catalog their collections and create an archive of comic releases. Similar to Bookogs, users can contribute comics, manga, graphic novels, and strips to the database, along with information on credits, publishers, writers, etc. 18,000 comics were submitted by the start of 2018. The Comicogs marketplace was launched on 23 August 2017, allowing users to buy and sell comics from across the world.\\n\\n\\n=== Posterogs ===\\nIn September 2017, the company launched Posterogs. Posterogs was the only Discogs site to launch a database and marketplace simultaneously. The scope of Posterogs was left broad at the time of launch, with the company opting to let the community define what type of posters, flyers, or similar, should be included in the database. As users have contributed items to the database, while non-music related items are fully acceptable for inclusion, much of the primary focus seems to be music posters, such as gig/tour posters, album promo posters, and promotional flyers - which is in keeping with Discogs' music theme, though there are also many film posters in the database. As with all other databases, users can save posters to their 'Collection' and 'Wantlist', in addition to buying and selling in the marketplace.\\n\\n\\n== API ==\\nIn mid-August 2007, Discogs data became publicly accessible via a RESTful, XML-based API and a license that allowed specially attributed use, but did not allow anyone to \\\"alter, transform, or build upon\\\" the data. The license has since been changed to a public domain one. Prior to the advent of this license and API, Discogs data was only accessible via the Discogs web site's HTML interface and was intended to be viewed only using web browsers. The HTML interface remains the only authorized way to modify Discogs data.On 7 June 2011 version 2 of the API was released. Notable in this release was that a license key was no longer required, the default response was changed from XML to JSON, and the 5000 queries per day limit was removed (although a limit of 2000 image lookups per days was introduced).\\nOn 1 November 2011 a major update to version 2 of the API was released. This new release dropped support for XML, data is always returned in JSON format, however the monthly data dumps of new data are only provided in XML format.\\nOn 1 February 2014 Discogs modified their API so that image requests will now require OAuth authorization, requiring each user of third-party applications to have a Discogs \\\"application ID\\\", with image requests now limited to 1,000 per day. Additionally the Premium API service was dropped.On 24 June 2014 Discogs deprecated their XML API in lieu of a JSON-formatted API.Discogs also allows full XML downloads of its Release, Artist, and Label data through the data.discogs.com subdomain.\\nThe recommendations API is not publicly available.\\n\\n\\n== Contribution system ==\\nThe data in Discogs comes from submissions contributed by users who have registered accounts on the web site. The system has gone through four major revisions.\\n\\n\\n=== Version One (V1) ===\\nAll incoming submissions were checked for formal and factual correctness by privileged users called \\\"moderators\\\", or \\\"mods\\\" for short, who had been selected by site management. Submissions and edits wouldn't become visible or searchable until they received a single positive vote from a \\\"mod\\\". An even smaller pool of super-moderators called \\\"editors\\\" had the power to vote on proposed edits to artist & label data.\\n\\n\\n=== Version Two (V2) ===\\nThis version introduced the concept of \\\"submission limits\\\" which prevented new users from submitting more than 2-3 releases for moderation. The number of possible submissions by a user increased on a logarithmic scale. The purpose of this was two-fold: 1) it helped keep the submission queue fairly small and manageable for moderators, and 2) it allowed the new user to acclimatise themselves slowly with the many formatting rules and guidelines of submitting to Discogs. Releases required a number of votes to be accepted into the database - initially the number of votes required was from 4 different moderators but in time the amount was decreased to 3 and then 2.\\n\\n\\n=== Version Three (V3) ===\\nV3 launched in August 2007. Submission limits were eliminated, allowing each user to submit an unlimited number of updates and new entries. New releases added to the database were explicitly marked as \\\"Unmoderated\\\" with a top banner, and updates to existing items, such as releases, artists, or labels, were not shown (or available to search engines or casual visitors) until they were approved by the moderators.\\n\\n\\n=== Version Four (V4) ===\\nThis system launched on 10 March 2008. New submissions and edits currently take effect immediately. Any time a new release is added or old release edited, that entry becomes flagged as needing \\\"votes\\\" (initially, \\\"review,\\\" but this term caused confusion). A flagged entry is marked as a full yellow bar across a release in the list views and, like version three, a banner on the submission itself - although, initially, this banner was omitted.\\nAny item can be voted on at any time, even if it isn't flagged. Votes consist of a rating of the correctness & completeness of the full set of data for an item (not just the most recent changes), as assessed by users who have been automatically determined, by an undisclosed algorithm, to be experienced & reliable enough to be allowed to cast votes. An item's \\\"average\\\" vote is displayed with the item's data.The ranking system has also changed in v4. In v3, rank points were only awarded to submitters when a submission was \\\"Accepted\\\" by moderator votes. While in v4, rank points are now awarded immediately when a submission is made, regardless of the accuracy of the information and what votes it eventually receives, if any.\\n\\n\\n== Discogs-aware metadata software ==\\n\\n\\n=== Tag editors ===\\n\\nASMT MP3 Tagger - single release tagger\\nfoobar2000 - freeware media player and music management software with a plugin\\nHelium Music Manager - music management software with a plugin\\nJaikoz - shareware OS X/Windows/Linux spreadsheet-based tag editor\\nKid3 - open-source project, tagger for all common music formats\\nMp3tag - freeware tag editor, batch and spreadsheet interfaces\\nOrangeCD Catalog - music management software\\npuddletag - a free and open-source tag editor written for PyQt\\ntaghycardia - freeware, automated MP3 tagger\\nTagog - Linux audio file tagger\\nTagScanner - freeware tag editor with Discogs, FreeDB, TrackType.org support\\nThe GodFather - freeware tag editor\\nThe Tagger - MP3 and AAC formats tag editor for OS X\\nTigoTago - spreadsheet-based tag editor\\n\\n\\n=== Other ===\\nMP3 Filenamer - online MP3 file name generator, based on Discogs release data\\nDiscogs Bar - Discogs navigation and search control toolbar for Firefox\\nAlbum Art Downloader - Discogs cover art downloads\\nWWW::Discogs - Perl module for interfacing with the Discogs API\\nXLD (X Lossless Decoder) - a CD ripper and audio file converter for OS X\\nMusic Collector - Music database software by collectorz.com\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nList of online music databases\\nGlobal Electronic Music Marketplace\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nDiscogs - official site\\nDiscogs wiki\", \"rev_id\": 854314699, \"accessed\": \"2018-09-03 00:12:00.995981\", \"links\": [\"Slashdot\", \"List of online music databases\", \"Jaikoz\", \"PyQt\", \"Linux\", \"HTML\", \"Kid3\", \"Portland, Oregon\", \"JSON\", \"Global Electronic Music Marketplace\", \"OS X\", \"Tag editor\", \"MP3\", \"XML\", \"OAuth\", \"Firefox\", \"Mp3tag\", \"Open Directory Project\"]}, {\"title\": \"Erykah Badu\", \"link_id\": \"Erykah Badu\", \"summary\": \"Erica Abi Wright (born February 26, 1971), known professionally as Erykah Badu (), is an American singer-songwriter, record producer, disc jockey, activist, and actress.\\nBadu's career began after opening a show for D'Angelo in 1994 in Fort Worth; record label executive Kedar Massenburg was highly impressed with her performance and signed her to Kedar Entertainment.

She also speaks at length in the documentaries Before the Music Dies and The Black Power Mixtapes.\\n\\n\\n== Early life ==\\nErykah Badu was born Erica Abi Wright in Dallas, Texas. Her mother raised her, her brother Eevin, and her sister Nayrok alone after separating from their father, William Wright Jr. To provide for her family, the children's maternal and paternal grandmothers often helped look after them. Badu had her first taste of show business at the age of four, singing and dancing at the Dallas Theater Center and The Black Academy of Arts and Letters (TBAAL) under the guidance of her godmother, Gwen Hargrove, and uncle TBAAL founder Curtis King.\\nBy the age of 14, Badu was freestyling for a local radio station alongside such talent as Roy Hargrove. In her youth, she had decided to change the spelling of her first name from Erica to Erykah, as she believed her original name was a \\\"slave name\\\". The term \\\"kah\\\" signifies the inner self. She adopted the surname \\\"Badu\\\" because it is her favorite jazz scat sound; also, among the Akan people in Ghana, it is the term for the 10th-born child.Upon graduating from Booker T. Washington High School for the Performing and Visual Arts, Badu went on to study theater at Grambling State University, a historically black university. To concentrate on music full-time, she left the university in 1993 before graduating, and took several minimum-wage jobs to support herself. She taught drama and dance to children at the South Dallas Cultural Center. Working and touring with her cousin, Robert \\\"Free\\\" Bradford, she recorded a 19-song demo, Country Cousins, which attracted the attention of Kedar Massenburg. He set Badu up to record a duet with D'Angelo, \\\"Your Precious Love\\\", and eventually signed her to a record deal with Universal Records.\\n\\n\\n== Career ==\\n\\n\\n=== Baduizm and Live (1997-99) ===\\nBaduizm, Badu's debut album, was released in early 1997. The album met with critical and commercial success, debuting at number two on the Billboard charts and number one on the US Billboard Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums. Baduizm's commercial and critical success helped establish Badu as one of the emerging neo soul genre's leading artists. Her particular style of singing drew many comparisons to Billie Holiday.Baduizm was certified three times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America, Gold by the British Phonographic Industry and the Canadian Recording Industry Association.\\n\\nThe album produced four singles; the lead single \\\"On & On\\\" was released in January 1996, and reached number twelve on the US Billboard Hot 100 charts and the UK Singles Charts, as well as making an appearance on the New Zealand charts. The album and lead single also gave Badu her first nomination and win at the Grammy Awards, where \\\"On & On\\\" won Best Female R&B Vocal Performance and the album won Best R&B Album.Badu recorded her first live album, Live, while pregnant with Seven, and the release of the recording coincided with his birth. The album was released on November 18, 1997 and reached number four on the US Billboard 200\\nand number one on the US Billboard Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums. The album was certified two times platinum by RIAA for shipments of over two million copies. The album's lead single, \\\"Tyrone\\\", was released in October 1997 and became another R&B hit single. \\\"Tyrone\\\", lyrically, is a song chiding a selfish, cheap, and inattentive boyfriend.\\nBadu also collaborated with the Roots (who had previously handled production duties on a number of tracks on Baduizm) on their breakthrough 1999 release Things Fall Apart. She was featured on the song \\\"You Got Me\\\", by The Roots and American female rapper Eve. Co-written by Jill Scott, the song peaked at 39 in the US and 31 in the UK. The song went on to win The Roots and Badu a Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group in 1999.\\n\\n\\n=== Mama's Gun and Worldwide Underground (2000-06) ===\\n\\nAfter taking some time off to raise her child, Badu returned in 2000 with Mama's Gun. The album was characterized as more organic in sound than her previous studio album, and primarily produced by the Soulquarians and noted bassist Pino Palladino. A remix of one of the album's songs, \\\"Bag Lady\\\", was issued as the first single and topped the R&B charts for seven weeks. The album was well-received, with the lyrical content winning notices from many publications. Reviewers found some of her lyrics hard to decipher on her initial releases. Despite not charting as high as her first two albums, Mama's Gun was another platinum-selling success, and \\\"Bag Lady\\\" was nominated for a Grammy Award.\\nBy 2000, Badu was in a romantic relationship with fellow Soulquarian Common. The two released \\\"Love of My Life (An Ode to Hip-Hop)\\\" as a collaboration on the Brown Sugar soundtrack. \\\"Love of My Life\\\" hit #9 on the pop charts, topped the R&B listings, and in 2003 Badu was awarded her fourth Grammy Award for it.\\nIn 2001 Badu embarked on the Mama's Gun World Tour. The tour started in North America on February 10 in Cleveland, Ohio at the Allen Theatre. Badu will perform two nights in Washington, D.C. and Chicago. The tour itinerary will continue with additional dates throughout the summer in Europe and the U.S.\\nAfter the release of Mama's Gun and \\\"Love of My Life\\\", Badu suffered writer's block.On September 16, 2003, she released her third studio album, Worldwide Underground. The album was more jam-oriented than any of her prior releases, and Badu said that the album was designed to as \\\"one continuous groove.\\\" Upon its release Worldwide Underground met with some criticism for its loose, unconventional structure and songwriting, but the album received generally positive reviews from critics.\\nCommercially the album fared well and debuted at number three on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart in the week of October 4, 2003, selling 143,561 copies in its first week. Ultimately spending 11 weeks on the Billboard 200, it also entered at number two on Billboard's Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums and spent 30 weeks on the chart. By December 2003, the album had sold 394,000 copies domestically. On October 28, 2003, Worldwide Underground was certified gold in sales by the Recording Industry Association of America, following sales in excess of 500,000 copies in the United States. According to Nielsen SoundScan, the album has sold 609,000 copies in the United States.Its first single, \\\"Love of My Life (An Ode to Hip Hop)\\\", peaked at number nine on the Billboard Hot 100 and at number one on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. The second single \\\"Danger\\\" reached number 82 on the Hot 100 and number 27 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs, while the third single \\\"Back in the Day (Puff)\\\" peaked at number 62 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. Badu received four further Grammy nominations for the album. She also contributed to Zap Mama's album Ancestry in Progress (2004), adding her vocals to the track \\\"Bandy Bandy.\\\"\\nBadu embarked on the \\\"Worldwide Underground Tour\\\" in 2004. The U.S. trek kicked off February 3 in New Orleans and ran through the winter and spring with supporting act Floetry joining the tour February 5 in Houston. The Roots made a special opening act appearance at the February 11 show in Los Angeles. Badu resumed the tour during the fall with additional dates in America and Europe.\\n\\nIn 2005, she was a judge for the 4th Annual Independent Music Awards, to support independent artists' careers. Badu co-founded the Sugar Water Festival with Queen Latifah and Jill Scott. The trek played to amphitheaters and arenas in the United States during the summer of 2005 and 2006. It began in 2005 as an event to bring awareness to health issues to African-American women. British duo Floetry opened shows during the 2005 run. The festival was relaunched briefly in 2006 with Kelis opening the show and comedian Mo'Nique hosting the festival. 2006 was its final year. The festival had plans to expand into Europe and Asia, but this did not come to fruition. The Summer Tour was a concert tour in 2006 by Badu. The tour started on June 10, in Knoxville, TN, with three shows in the U.S., and resumed in July for several shows in Europe. Badu co-headlined on dates in August with Jill Scott and Queen Latifah at the Sugar Water Festival.\\n\\n\\n=== New Amerykah Part One (2007-09) ===\\nAfter receiving her first computer as a Christmas gift, Badu began communicating with and receiving music from Questlove, Q-Tip and J Dilla, among others. She later began to use her laptop as a mini recording studio to construct various backing tracks for songs, which led to the album's primary recording sessions at Electric Lady Studios in New York City.\\nIn 2007 Badu was said to have three albums in the works for release during 2007 and 2008. \\\"Honey\\\", a new single produced by 9th Wonder, was leaked online in November 2007. The fourth studio album, New Amerykah Part One, was released by Universal Motown Records, in the United States on February 26, 2008, Badu's 37th birthday. It was released in European countries on February 29, in Australia and the United Kingdom on March 3, and in Japan on March 12. Both Japanese and Australian editions contain the bonus track \\\"Real Thang\\\". The album's digital release on the iTunes Store featured the song's \\\"Tumbling Dice Remix\\\" as a bonus track. New Amerykah Part One was also released as a double vinyl LP on March 11, and on USB stick format.The album's lead single, \\\"Honey\\\", was released on December 11, 2007. It reached number 88 on the US Billboard Hot 100, on which it spent three weeks. The song also charted at number 22 and spent 17 weeks on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs.\\nUpon release New Amerykah Part One (4th World War) received universal acclaim from critics.\\nIn the United States, the album debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 chart, selling 125,000 copies in its first week. It was Badu's best opening week since her debut album Baduizm in 1997. It also entered at number two on the Billboard Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums.\\nAccording to Nielsen Soundscan, New Amerykah Part One (4th World War) sold 359,000 copies in the United States by early 2010.Erykah Badu performed at the 10th annual Voodoo Experience in New Orleans the weekend before Halloween 2008.\\nIn the United Kingdom, the album charted at number 55 on the UK Albums Chart, on which it spent one week. In France, it debuted at number 49 and spent 11 weeks on the French Albums Chart. In Switzerland, it debuted at number 10 and spent six weeks on the Swiss Albums Top 100. In the Netherlands, the album entered at number 25 and spent seven weeks on the Mega Album Top 100. In Poland, it reached number nine and spent eight weeks on the Polish Albums Chart. The album's highest international charting was number five in Sweden, where it charted for seven weeks.During 2008 and 2009 Badu embarked on two world tours. The Vortex Tour (2008) was a tour in support of New Amerykah Part One. The U.S. tour kicked off May 4 in Detroit, MI, ending on June 15 in Albuquerque, NM.

Several more shows were added throughout August in the U.S. The Jam Tour was a summer music concert tour in 2009. The tour started in March; Badu played dates across North America twice and Europe, and the tour ended in Dallas, Texas on October 16. During the second U.S. leg, Badu was featured as a special guest co-headliner on hip-hop artist Mos Def's \\\"Ecstatic Tour\\\" on select September dates.\\n\\n\\n=== New Amerykah Part Two and Window Seat controversy (2010-14) ===\\n\\n\\\"New Amerykah Part Two (Return of the Ankh)\\\", Badu's fifth studio album, was released March 30, 2010, on Universal Motown in the United States. It was released in Japan on April 14, 2010. Upon release the album was met with general acclaim from critics. The album debuted at number four on the US Billboard 200 chart, selling 110,000 copies in its first week. It also entered at number two on Billboard's R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. In the United Kingdom, New Amerykah Part Two (Return of the Ankh) debuted at number 56 on the UK Albums Chart and at number nine on the R&B Albums Chart. In Canada, the album debuted at number 36 on the Top 100 and at number five on the R&B Top 50 chart. New Amerykah Part Two achieved moderate chart success in international markets, peaking within the top 50 in several countries, including Norway, Poland, Switzerland, Sweden, and Denmark.During March 2010, Badu promoted the album through television performances on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon, The Wendy Williams Show, Chelsea Lately, Jimmy Kimmel Live!, and Good Day New York. She also appeared on the April issue cover of EQ magazine and was featured in issues of Nylon, Playboy,  Rolling Stone, Entertainment Weekly, Time Out New York, Spin, Vibe, Paste, and People, among others. Badu performed at a surprise midnight show on March 31, 2010 at the El Rey Theatre in Los Angeles.The internet-only promotional single \\\"Jump up in the Air (Stay There)\\\", featuring Lil Wayne and Bilal, was released on Badu's official website in January 2010. RC Williams, Badu's musical director, said that a music video for the track was shot in Dallas.\\nThe album's first official single, \\\"Window Seat\\\", was released by Badu through a downloadable link on her Twitter page. The song peaked at number 16 on Billboard R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. The album's second single, \\\"Turn Me Away (Get MuNNY)\\\", was released March 24, 2010 by Badu as a free download online. It spent three weeks on the R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, peaking at number 87.\\nOn Wednesday, February 9, 2011, Vimeo.com released a new video for \\\"Gone Baby, Don't Be Long\\\", directed by Flying Lotus. The video was tweeted by Badu herself and friend and associated music act Questlove from the Roots.On March 13, 2010, Badu filmed the video for her song \\\"Window Seat\\\", at Dealey Plaza in Dallas, Texas, the site of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. She wrote on her Twitter feed that the video \\\"was shot guerrilla style, no crew, 1 take, no closed set, no warning, 2 min., Downtown Dallas, then ran like hell.\\\" The team did not acquire permission or permits from the city.\\nIn the video, Badu shed her clothes as she walked along a Dallas sidewalk until she was nude at the site where Kennedy was shot. A shot rang out as the song ended, Badu's head jerked back, and she fell to the ground. Children with their families could be seen nearby as Badu stripped. When asked about stripping nude in the presence of minors, Badu said, \\\"I didn't think about them until I saw them, and in my mind I tried to telepathically communicate my good intent to them. That's all I could do, and I hoped they wouldn't be traumatized.\\\"\\n\\nIn response, Badu said on The Wanda Sykes Show on April 3, 2010, that it was not her intention to insult the memory of the late President John F. Kennedy (JFK): \\\"My point was grossly misunderstood all over America. JFK is one of my heroes, one of the nation's heroes. John F. Kennedy was a revolutionary; he was not afraid to butt heads with America, and I was not afraid to show America my butt-naked truth.\\\" Coodie and Chike, directors of the \\\"Window Seat\\\" video, said they had bail money ready during filming in case Badu was arrested. Badu said the video was a protest against \\\"groupthink\\\" and was inspired by Matt and Kim's music video \\\"Lessons Learned.\\\" Badu has also said she has \\\"no regrets\\\".In 2011 Badu appeared on Flying Lotus's fourth album, Until the Quiet Comes. Badu appeared on the debut album by the supergroup Rocketjuice and The Moon, which was released in March 2012 and the album Black Radio by Robert Glasper.\\nIn 2013, Badu appeared on \\\"Treehome95\\\" from Tyler, The Creator's second studio album, Wolf as well as on the song \\\"Heaven for the Sinner\\\" from Bonobo's album The North Borders. Badu featured on Janelle Monae's first single from her second studio album, The Electric Lady, \\\"Q.U.E.E.N.\\\" The song premiered on SoundCloud and was made available for download purchase at the iTunes Store on April 23, 2013. The song peaked at 47 on the US Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs charts.\\n\\n\\n=== New album and mixtapes (2015-present) ===\\nIn May 2013, Badu announced she was writing her next project, but not placing a time constraint on it.\\nIn July 2014, Badu revealed she was still working on the album and had been recording in April in Africa where she was \\\"laying down drum tracks\\\". Badu also said that prior to her trip to Africa she would have meetings with her record label to set a deadline for the album.\\nLater that year Badu expanded on the album, stating she was working with producer Flying Lotus, who she met via MySpace years ago; they later met in L.A. at guitarist Steve Wilson's house. In 2015 Badu appeared on \\\"Rememory\\\", a song from Donnie Trumpet & The Social Experiment's album Surf.\\nIn July 2015, Badu released a free mixtape of her favorite recordings, describing the set as \\\"carefully and lovingly selected high frequency tones for the soul.\\\" The mixtape features mostly vintage funk, soul and jazz songs.\\nOn March 26, 2015, Erykah Badu performed at The Bomb Factory in her hometown, Dallas, Texas, for the Deep Ellum venue's grand opening. The sold-out show also featured fellow Dallas native, singer-songwriter Sarah Jaffe.In early October, Badu released a remix of Drake's single \\\"Hotline Bling\\\", and later released a mixtape, But You Caint Use My Phone, on November 27, 2015, making it available for digital download and streaming exclusively through Apple Music. After one week of exclusive release on iTunes, But You Caint Use My Phone was released to other digital retailers and streaming services on December 4, 2015. The mixtape was released without the knowledge of her label Universal, due to Badu sending the record straight to iTunes. It also marked Badu's first release under her own record label, Control Freaq. But You Caint Use My Phone received generally positive reviews from critics and debuted at number 14 on the Billboard 200, selling 35,000 equivalent album units in its first week. Badu also hosted the 2015, 2016 and the 2017 Soul Train Music Awards.Just within two months after the release of But You Caint Use My Phone, in 2016 and Badu announced a follow up mixtape titled This $hit Too Easy was to be released, however this mixtape hasn't surfaced. The same year, Badu released new three tracks on SoundCloud, including Trill Friends, Thru It All and Come See Badu. Later on January 24, 2018 she announced a release of a new mixtape, but like the aforementioned mixtape, remains unreleased. In a publication on Vulture, Badu announced she was slowly making progress on her sixth studio album.  \\nBadu held her annual \\\"Still Boomin'\\\" sold-out birthday bash concert at The Bomb Factory on February 26, 2016, marking her second performance at the venue since its grand opening 11 months earlier. The event was hosted by Badu's close friend Dave Chappelle and featured a surprise appearance by Outkast frontman Andre 3000. Badu enlisted Dallas local hip hop acts -topic, Zach Witness, and Cameron McCloud as her supporting acts.On August 15, 2018, the NPR video series Tiny Desk Concerts, released a new episode featuring Erykah Badu and her band performing live. The same day, NPR released the What's Good with Stretch & Bobbito podcast episode featuring a fresh interview with Erykah Badu where she spoke of being a certified doula, her inherited sense of humor from her mother, stand-up comedy, her avoidance of print interviews after her 2008 experience being misquoted, and Prince.\\n\\n\\n== Other ventures ==\\nBadu has also ventured into acting. She made her debut as a supporting role in the 1998 film Blues Brothers 2000, playing Queen Mousette. The film gained mostly mixed to negative reviews from film critics and was considered a commercial failure. Badu made her second appearances in The Cider House Rules (1999), where she played the character of Rose Rose. The film fared well both critically and commercially, with Badu receiving numerous awards and nominations including a win at the 2000 Black Reel Awards for best supporting actress as well as nominations for Screen Actors Guild Awards and Satellite Awards.In 2004 Badu returned to the screen playing Lady/Bernadette in House of D. Badu also had small roles in Before the Music Dies (2005), and Dave Chappelle's Block Party (2006). She is reported to have a leading role alongside Mos Def in the upcoming indie film, Bobby Zero, which tells a story of a struggling couple, who hit rock bottom after Mos Def's character gives up his artistic dream to pursue an advertising corporate job to live on. She also appeared in scenes of the music video of Miko Marks' 2006 recording \\\"Mama\\\" and Common's video for \\\"The Light,\\\" as well as making a special appearance on the sitcom Girlfriends.\\n\\nIn 2008 Badu became the face of fashion designer Tom Ford White Patchouli fragrance. Ford, longtime friends with Badu, considered her the best choice for the campaign. \\\"I have always considered her a true beauty ... she just fits\\\", says Ford. In late December 2013, it was announced that Badu would become the face of Givenchy's 2014 Spring collection. Badu made her New York Fashion Week debut alongside designer Kerby Jean-Raymond in 2016, styling for his Pyer Moss collection titled \\\"Double Bind.\\\"  Erykah Badu and Kerby Jean-Raymond titled this collection after Gregory Bateson's idea Double bind. Badu called this collection a \\\"movement\\\" against issues including depression, racism, and hatred.Badu also remains an activist in her hometown of South Dallas.\\nIn Nation19 Magazine Badu talked about why she set up her own charity organization, titled Beautiful Love Incorporated Non Profit Development (B.L.I.N.D. 501c3). The charity was established in 1997 and aims to provide \\\"community-driven development for inner-city youth\\\" through the use of music, dance, theater and visual arts. The organization's first endeavor was to establish a base of operations. Erykah chose to renovate and reopen the Black Forest Theater in South Dallas.\\nThe Black Forest serves as a community center, bringing people together in order to celebrate the art and culture of south Dallas.\\nThe Black Forest's stage is equipped for shows and performances, and has hosted both free and fundraising concerts by music artists including Prince, Snoop Dogg, Jill Scott, Musiq Soulchild, Dead Prez, Talib Kweli and Questlove from The Roots. All of the artists volunteered their time to help with the charity.\\nAs an outreach for B.L.I.N.D., Erykah traveled to Africa in February 2003, where she worked with children affected by AIDS and poverty. Erykah has also received the Key to the City of Dallas and been recognized in Philanthropy Magazine for her efforts in community service.\\n\\n\\n== Musical style ==\\nBadu's work draws from R&B, 1970s soul, and 1980s hip hop, and became associated with the neo soul subgenre in the 1990s along with artists like D'Angelo. For her musical sensibilities, she has often been compared to jazz great Billie Holiday. Badu's has been described as an experimental R&B singer, and her work explores contemporary forms of soul and hip hop. Mama's Gun is a neo soul album, that incorporates funk, soul, and jazz styles. The album has been viewed by critics as a female companion to neo soul artist D'Angelo's second album Voodoo (2000), which features a similar musical style and direction.Worldwide Underground followed in the same vein as Badu's previous efforts: the album is neo-soul and prominently incorporates hip hop and funk elements, while also featuring an unconventional musical structure.\\nNew Amerykah Part One has a dense stylistic amalgam that primarily incorporates funk, soul, and hip hop genres, as well as jazz and electronica.\\nIn contrast to its predecessor, New Amerykah Part One (2008), which was digitally produced and political in tone, New Amerykah Part Two (Return of the Ankh) incorporates sampling and live instrumentation.\\n\\nThe majority of Badu's music is greatly influenced by her beliefs of the Nation of Gods and Earths and her exploration of her African heritage. The songs in her album Baduizm express her personal take on life. Her philosophy is influenced by African ideology, African-centered and Five Percent theologies, and Southern African-American folk traditions. Mama's Gun has an confessional lyrical theme, covering themes of insecurity, social issues, and personal relationships.\\nWorldwide Underground contains minimalist songwriting concerning hip hop culture, love, ghetto life, and gang culture. New Amerykah Part One is an esoteric concept album with sociopolitical themes and mostly downbeat subject matter, featuring more impersonal topics and social commentary than on Badu's previous work. Its subject matter deals with social concerns and struggles within the African-American community, exploring topics such as institutional racism, religion, poverty, urban violence, the abuse of power, complacency, cultural identity, drug addiction, and nihilism. Badu has said that the album discusses \\\"religion, [...] poor families, the undermining of the working class, the so-called minority\\\", Lyrically, New Amerykah Part Two is more personal than its predecessor, focusing on themes of romance and relationships. Badu has described its sound as \\\"very analog\\\".During Badu's childhood and school years, she drew influences from a variety of hip-hop artists including Kool Herc, Red Alert, DJ Jazzy Jeff, DJ Spinderella and Salt 'n' Pepa; expanding on this she noted the previous rappers as being \\\"very inspiring to me, because they were the people who conducted feelings\\\". Badu is inspired by \\\"stimulating\\\" experiences. She was also influenced greatly by her music teacher Ms. Goodman, who encouraged her to take up music. Badu also takes influence from her grandmother and her religious views which Erykah described as a lesson saying \\\"When you do it, it gotta be real, or that's not it.\\\"\\n\\n\\n== Accolades ==\\n\\nIn 1997, Badu received six nominations and won three, Favorite Female Solo Single for \\\"On & On\\\", Favorite Female Solo Album for Baduizm and Best R&B/Soul or Rap Song of the Year for \\\"On & On\\\" at the Soul Train Lady of Soul Awards.\\nIn 1998, Badu received fourteen nominations and won eight, including Favorite R&B/Soul or Rap New Artist at the American Music Awards; Best Female R&B Vocal Performance for \\\"On & On\\\" and Best R&B Album for Baduizm at the Grammy Awards; Outstanding New Artist and Outstanding Female Artist at the NAACP Image Awards; Favorite Female Soul/R&B Single for \\\"On & On\\\", Favorite Female Soul/R&B Album for Baduizm and Favorite New R&B/Soul or Rap New Artist for \\\"On & On\\\" at the Soul Train Music Awards.In 2000, Badu received two nominations and won one, Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group at the Grammy Awards.\\nIn 2003, Badu received twelve nominations and won two, including Video of the Year for \\\"Love of My Life (An Ode to Hip-Hop)\\\" at the BET Awards and Best Urban/Alternative Performance for \\\"Love of My Life (An Ode to Hip-Hop)\\\" at the Grammy Awards.\\nIn 2008, Badu received eleven nominations and won two, including Best Director for \\\"Honey\\\" at the BET Awards and Best Direction in a Video for \\\"Honey\\\" at the MTV Video Music Awards. Overall, Badu has won 16 awards from 59 nominations.\\n\\n\\n== Legacy ==\\n\\nAlthough she disputes the term, Erykah Badu has been dubbed \\\"the first lady of neo soul\\\" and \\\"the queen of neo-soul\\\".Baduizm's commercial and critical success earned Erykah Badu popularity at the time and helped establish her as one of the emerging neo soul genre's leading artists. Along with D'Angelo's Brown Sugar (1995) and Maxwell's Urban Hang Suite (1996), the album has been recognized by music writers for beginning neo soul's popularity and helping the genre obtain commercial visibility at the time.\\n\\n\\n== Personal life ==\\nAfter 10 years as a vegetarian, Badu became a vegan in 2006: \\\"Vegan food is soul food in its truest form. Soul food means to feed the soul. And to me, your soul is your intent. If your intent is pure, you are pure.\\\"\\nBadu splits her time between Dallas, Texas and Fort Greene, New York.In 1995, Badu became involved with rapper Andre 3000 of OutKast, with whom she had her first child, a son named Seven Sirius Benjamin, on November 18, 1997. Their relationship ended sometime in 1999. Their relationship inspired Andre 3000 to write the song \\\"Ms. Jackson\\\".\\nIn 2000, Badu was in a romantic relationship with fellow Soulquarian Common; their relationship ended in 2002. On July 5, 2004, Badu gave birth to a daughter, Puma Sabti Curry; Puma's father is West Coast rapper The D.O.C., originally from Dallas. On February 1, 2009, Badu gave birth to her third child, a girl named Mars Merkaba Thedford, with her boyfriend of five years, rapper Jay Electronica.\\n\\n\\n== Legal issues and controversies ==\\nOn April 2, 2010, Badu was charged with disorderly conduct for appearing nude in Dealey Plaza in Dallas, Texas while filming the social-political, performance art, self-directed music video for \\\"Window Seat\\\". No witnesses called police at the time of the incident, but the Dallas Police Department actively sought witnesses after the release of the video. Sgt. Warren Mitchell said the decision to cite Badu for a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of up to $500 - came after witness Ida Espinosa, 32, of Vernon, offered a sworn statement to police Thursday, April 1. Espinosa declined to comment to The Associated Press. On April 28, 2010, Badu pleaded not guilty rather than paying the fee by mail. On August 13, she paid the $500 ticket and began a term of six months' probation.In February 2012, Badu's concert was cancelled in Malaysia because it was found that she had applied a temporary tattoo of the word Allah on a part of her body.In April 2014, Badu came under fire by the US-based Human Rights Foundation, for performing at the birthday celebration of Swaziland's ruler and monarch, King Mswati III. Mswati, credited as Africa's last absolute monarch, is considered to be a serial human-rights abuser, ruling in luxury in a country famed for its poverty and spiralling HIV rates.\\nBadu presented Mswati with a $100 bill, and a good-luck stone.In a January 2018 interview with Vulture, Badu was asked about her perceived antisemitism based on a 2008 Haaretz article quoting her thoughts about Louis Farrakhan. She denied being antisemitic, but said, \\\"I see good in everybody. I saw something good in Hitler.\\\" After being asked to clarify what she was saying, Badu said that Hitler was \\\"a wonderful painter.\\\" She also defended Bill Cosby, saying, \\\"I love Bill Cosby, and I love what he's done for the world. But if he's sick, why would I be angry with him?\\\"\\n\\n\\n== Discography ==\\n\\nStudio albums\\n\\nBaduizm (1997)\\nMama's Gun (2000)\\nWorldwide Underground (2003)\\nNew Amerykah Part One (2008)\\nNew Amerykah Part Two (2010)Live albums\\n\\nLive (1997)Mixtape\\n\\nFeel Better World! ...

The show has been nominated for nine Primetime Emmy Awards, winning two.\\nOn August 13, 2015, NBC announced that Fallon signed a contract to remain as host until at least 2021.\\n\\n\\n== Background ==\\n\\n\\n=== History ===\\nThe Tonight Show premiered on NBC in 1954 as Tonight, hosted by Steve Allen. Jack Paar hosted the show from 1957 to 1962, but the show's longest-running and most famous host was Johnny Carson, who hosted the show for three decades. Following Carson's 1992 retirement, \\\"vast quantities of brainpower, money, and column inches were devoted to the issue of who was truly best suited to carry the franchise forward.\\\" NBC chose interim guest host Jay Leno, who took over the show that year.\\nA pair of conflicts ensued over Leno's 22-year tenure, both revolving around the then-current hosts of Late Night, the program directly following Tonight since its premiere in 1982. Original Late Night host David Letterman was considered Carson's top choice as successor and left the network acrimoniously in 1993 after Leno was given the job. Years later, NBC attempted to transit Letterman's Late Night successor, Conan O'Brien to in turn succeed Leno as host of Tonight in 2009. However, as a result of various contractual obligations and fears of losing performers to other networks, Leno was given a nightly prime-time show shortly after Conan's run began. Leno posted less than stellar ratings, leading to a domino effect on the late local news. O'Brien's Tonight also suffered falling ratings leading to a public controversy that resulted in O'Brien leaving the network the following year, and Leno returning to host The Tonight Show.\\n\\nJimmy Fallon, a former cast member on Saturday Night Live, was appointed as the third host of Late Night by executive producer Lorne Michaels in 2009 when Conan moved to Tonight. Fallon incorporated the Internet much more than other talk shows. Between Fallon's own musical sensibilities and the recruitment of his house band, hip-hop collective The Roots, his incarnation of Late Night \\\"evolved into the most deeply musical of TV's musical-comedy variety programs\\\", with sketches in which he parodies Neil Young and Bruce Springsteen going viral online. Coincidentally, it was during the Tonight Show debacle that Fallon's show found its footing. The show, according to Fallon's former SNL castmate Tina Fey, established itself as \\\"an uncommonly warm, welcoming show.\\\" In 2010, New York complimented Fallon's \\\"good humor\\\" and noted his improvement: \\\"In the relative safety of his 12:35 a.m. time slot, Fallon has been cultivating a distinct, and refreshing, strain of humor: the comedy of unabashed celebration.\\\" \\\"In our heads, we've been doing The Tonight Show [...] We're just on at a later hour,\\\" Fallon said.\\n\\n\\n=== Transition ===\\nFallon grew up with no designs on the Tonight job (unlike O'Brien or Leno), most likely because he was just 17 years old when Carson retired. Discussions for Fallon to take over The Tonight Show began in early 2013, with the transition intended to happen by late 2014 at the latest. Many industry observers noted that the change appeared to come as a result of another late-night competitor, Jimmy Kimmel (24 years old at the time of Carson's retirement) of Jimmy Kimmel Live! on ABC, who moved to the 11:35 slot months prior; NBC feared that by waiting too long to promote Fallon, Kimmel could create a stranglehold on young demographics, which is key to the financial success of the franchise. Fallon had reportedly impressed top executives at Comcast (which had recently completed a full takeover of NBCUniversal), and his succession was widely expected throughout the company. The transition reportedly lacked the tension of previous Tonight transitions, and the program's relocation east \\\"signals NBC's strong commitment to not messing with the program any further.\\\"On April 3, 2013, NBC announced that Leno would retire in 2014, with Fallon taking over The Tonight Show beginning on February 24, 2014. At Leno's suggestion, the date was moved forward from the end of his contract in September 2014, to February so as to use NBC's coverage of the 2014 Winter Olympics as a springboard for Fallon's tenure. The date was later moved up a week to February 17, midway through the Olympics.As Leno's contract ran until September 2014, much of his staff were paid until that month.\\n\\n\\n=== Emphasis on sketch comedy ===\\n\\nBy bringing over many of his recurring bits and features from Late Night, Fallon has departed in a few ways from the format which Leno used for his show. Fallon's edition places less emphasis on his opening monologue, a feature which was a staple of the Leno edition. In his opening episode, in which he described what the format of the show would be, he only briefly mentioned the monologue.The show has many recurring segments and games that are played with the various celebrity guests. The most popular of these, Lip Sync Battle, was spun off into its own show by Fallon. Other segments include playing charades, Catchphrase, Pictionary, or other familial style games.\\nAdditionally, Fallon and celebrity guests regularly appear in sketches parodying pop culture or political events. These segments normally take place after the monologue, but have occurred as a cold open for the show on a few occasions. Just as he portrayed Mitt Romney during the 2012 election season, Fallon portrayed Republican candidate Donald Trump and Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders. Alongside Fallon's impressions, other celebrities occasionally appear. Several have recurring roles, including Dion Flynn as Barack Obama, David Alan Grier as Ben Carson, Aziz Ansari as Bobby Jindal, the show's announcer Steve Higgins as Jeb Bush, and the show's head writer AD Miles as Lindsey Graham.After his critically acclaimed appearances as Trump on Tonight, Fallon was asked to play the role on the December 19, 2015 episode of Saturday Night Live, since Taran Killam (who had been announced as the season's Trump) would be busy playing Ted Cruz. Fallon accepted the offer, but the plan fell through at some point before the show. The role was filled by Darrell Hammond, who played Trump over his fourteen years on SNL.Fallon has also appeared as figures such as Vladimir Putin and Bob Dylan.\\n\\n\\n== Production ==\\n\\nThe Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon originates from NBC Studio 6-B at 30 Rockefeller Plaza in New York City, the original home of The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, where it is taped every weekday at 5pm. The studio housed both Carson and his predecessor, Jack Paar, before the franchise's move to Burbank in 1972. \\\"It is where The Tonight Show started -- actually in the studio where we are going to be, that's where Johnny Carson was, there's Broadway, there's Times Square, there's something glamorous about it. That is The Tonight Show,\\\" Fallon remarked. NBC spent approximately $5 million renovating Studio 6-B, where Fallon had been taping Late Night, for The Tonight Show's return to New York City. The upgraded 6-B contains improved acoustics and a seating capacity of around 240, up from 189, but smaller than the seating capacity of The Late Late Show. The investment also included a new control room and a new lobby to welcome guests. The larger audience also meant NBC could take advantage of a newly enacted New York state tax credit for talk shows that are \\\"filmed before a studio audience of at least 200, as long as they carry a production budget of at least $30 million and have been shot outside New York for at least five seasons.\\\"  Fallon's Late Night successor, Seth Meyers, is housed directly above his studio in Studio 8-G; the combination created logistical challenges for executives, who were concerned about \\\"sound bleed\\\" (as the building was built with steel girders, sound is too easily conducted floor to floor). As a result, The Tonight Show tapes at 5:00pm, and Meyers' show tapes later in the evening, at 6:30pm. Additionally, because of The Roots' still active tour schedule, The Tonight Show tapes two shows on Thursday at New York, one for Thursday night's airing, and one for Friday night's airing. However, the show still tapes daily Monday through Wednesday throughout the week. Occasionally, they will tape a show on Friday for Friday night's show, but it is more common that they will tape two shows on Thursday.  \\nThe show's set was designed by theatrical set designer Eugene Lee, known for his credits on Saturday Night Live, whom Fallon thanked on-air on his first episode. The set \\\"emphasizes stained wood and a mid-century modern style,\\\" including \\\"a slate blue couch, a handsome honey-colored wood desk and matching walls.\\\" Behind the desk near the city backdrop is a wood-carved miniature replica of New York City skyscrapers. \\\"I think it's Eugene Lee's masterpiece,\\\" said producer Michaels. Fallon's monologue spot is noted by a painted four-leaf clover on the floor. \\\"Fallon's new set is purposefully old-fashioned compared to the college-cafe-in-the-meatpacking-district where he lived on Late Night,\\\" said Entertainment Weekly. USA Today called the set more \\\"intimate and theatrical\\\" than the set employed on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, and The New York Times called it more elegant, \\\"but also quite formal and a little impersonal.\\\" The show's logo, its title set against a full moon, is a callback to The Honeymooners, while the title is a throwback to Carson's tenure: Leno and O'Brien both favored a \\\"with,\\\" rather than \\\"starring,\\\" in their respective titles.In November 2014, a new marquee was added to the Avenue of the Americas entrance of 30 Rock, which promotes the building as the home of The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon; the new marquee was also designed so that it can be usable as a stage for performances. John Wallace, NBCUniversal's president of technical operations, described the marquee as being a \\\"bold statement\\\" that The Tonight Show had been brought back to New York. Fallon joked that the marquee \\\"makes it exponentially harder for them to fire me\\\", and that he was \\\"jealous of Letterman.\\\"\\n\\n\\n=== Format ===\\nThe show's opening sequence, directed by filmmaker Spike Lee, features Fallon visiting various New York City landmarks, including Grand Central Terminal and Katz's Delicatessen. Steve Higgins introduces the show with \\\"From Studio 6B in Rockefeller Center, in the heart of New York City, it's The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon!\\\" and announces that night's guests and \\\"the legendary Roots crew\\\". The show's theme song is \\\"energetic with jazzy overtones\\\" with \\\"Hey Jimmy\\\", designed to match the shots of the city. Just before Higgins introduces Fallon, the camera cuts to a shot of The Roots, and Questlove shouts the numbers symbolizing the episode number of The Tonight Show. Higgins then introduces Fallon with a drawn-out \\\"And now, here's your host/here he is, Jimmy Fallon!\\\", and Fallon begins his brief monologue.\\nPrior to composing an entirely new theme song, bandleader Questlove noted to Vanity Fair that they were considering a variation on Late Night's theme, which itself is a sped-up adaptation of The Roots' 2006 song \\\"Here I Come\\\". For their transition to The Tonight Show, The Roots added two horn players from Sharon Jones & The Dap-Kings (\\\"You can't be The Tonight Show without a horn section,\\\" said Questlove). As he did on Late Night, Jonathan Cohen supervises the show's musical guest bookings.\\nFollowing the monologue, the main segments are a mix of interviews and performances--examples of the latter include musical impressions, lip-syncing contests, games of Pictionary and egg Russian roulette. His celebrity interviews are throwbacks to \\\"Merv Griffin-style celebrity gush.\\\"Before the first airing of the show, Fallon expressed that it was essentially an extension of his tenure at Late Night, explaining that his Tonight Show would be \\\"the best of the best of what we do\\\". The show has carried over some of Late Night's well-known performance bits, such as \\\"Egg Russian Roulette\\\", a game in which Fallon challenges guests to pick random eggs and then smash them against their forehead to see whether the eggs are raw or hard-boiled. Each week, Fallon has carried over a popular sketch from his Late Night days: the absurdist \\\"Thank You Notes\\\" segment, in which \\\"he dutifully composes notes of gratitude to abstract concepts and inanimate objects.\\\" Another recurring segment, \\\"Tonight Show Superlatives\\\", features Fallon presenting yearbook-style superlatives relating to athletes (particularly, NFL players from the teams being featured that week on Sunday Night Football, or NHL players during the Stanley Cup playoffs).\\n\\n\\n=== Remote broadcasts ===\\nWhile the vast majority of episodes are produced at the show's New York home base, Fallon's Tonight Show has gone on the road to produce episodes remotely in its first year, spending four nights at Universal Orlando Resort in Florida in June 2014 to promote new attractions at NBCUniversal's theme parks there. Four nights of shows from Universal Studios Hollywood in Los Angeles aired February 2015, in the days immediately following a special Sunday night show from Phoenix, Arizona airing after NBC's coverage of Super Bowl XLIX on February 1, using the Stage One facility previously utilized for Conan O'Brien's Tonight Show run, and also E!'s Chelsea Lately until its August 2014 end. The L.A. shows brought Tonight back to the locale where it had been based since Johnny Carson relocated the program from New York in 1972 until the start of Fallon's tenure, and echoes Carson himself hosting special broadcasts from the L.A. region prior to the relocation. Fallon hosted The Tonight Show again from Universal Orlando Resort, April 3-6, 2017, in anticipation of the opening of Race Through New York Starring Jimmy Fallon, a motion simulator attraction based on his tenure at the show. Fallon once again aired a special episode after Super Bowl LII, from Minneapolis' Orpheum Theatre.\\n\\n\\n== Episodes ==\\n\\n\\n=== Notable episodes ===\\n\\nIn the show's debut episode, Fallon introduced his supporting stars and gave a brief history of his life and career, following it up with a sketch, \\\"The Evolution of Hip-Hop Dancing\\\", with actor Will Smith and a musical performance by U2 at the Top of the Rock. Following the show's premiere, many notable episodes of the show have produced segments that went viral on sites like Facebook and YouTube. Among the show's most popular bits are lip sync battles; one featuring actress Emma Stone aired in April 2014 is the most highly watched online video of the program. In October 2014, actor Daniel Radcliffe recited rapper Blackalicious' \\\"Alphabet Aerobics\\\", which became a popular viral video. Other clips, including the Wheel of Musical Impressions with singers Ariana Grande and Christina Aguilera have been widely viewed, as has a clip of Fallon and comedian Kevin Hart riding the Hollywood Rip Ride Rockit roller coaster during the show's first remote broadcast at Universal Studios Florida. Sketches that reunite casts of television shows, such as Saved By the Bell, in addition to a cappella versions of popular songs performed by Fallon and the Roots, have also been popular. The show's most widely circulated interview segment was one aired in January 2015 with actress Nicole Kidman, who jokingly revealed that she once had a crush on Fallon, to which at the time he was oblivious.On February 1, 2015, the showed aired, to date, its only live show from the Orpheum Theatre in Phoenix, Arizona as a lead-out program from NBC's broadcast of Super Bowl XLIX. The show included an appearance by Arnold Schwarzenegger, a lip-sync battle with Kevin Hart and Will Ferrell, appearances by Super Bowl Champion New England Patriots players, and a performance by Ariana Grande.\\nIn September 2016, Fallon faced criticism after an interview with the Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. Democrats felt that Fallon humanized Trump, who had made controversial statements (i.e. that some illegals bring drugs and crime) that they disagreed with. Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton had also appeared on the show prior that year. Fallon responded to the controversy claiming that nobody should have expected him to ask difficult questions since he is never hard on anyone. Fallon acknowledged that the interview was a setback three months after Trump was inaugurated.\\n\\n\\n== Reception ==\\n\\n\\n=== Critical reviews ===\\nThe debut episode received mixed but generally positive reviews. The New York Times's Alessandra Stanley referred to the show's premiere as \\\"more sweet than sassy,\\\" calling Fallon \\\"the grateful heir, the eager freshman, the class clown with top grades and a good heart, someone older viewers can embrace without fear of being mocked or overlooked.\\\" Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter was positive in his assessment of the evening, but noted the older fanbase used to Leno may not latch on as quickly. \\\"Indeed, Fallon comes across as eager to please almost to a fault, and he treated his Tonight Show launch very much like a guy auditioning to be accepted into homes,\\\" said Brian Lowry of Variety, who considered the premiere episode a demonstration in Fallon's strengths and weaknesses.The first season of the show was deemed \\\"wildly successful.\\\" Entertainment Weekly summarized the show's inaugural year: \\\"In his first year as host of The Tonight Show, [Fallon] turned the revered late-night franchise into the hottest party in town, a celebrity playpen full of games, music, surprise guests, and good vibes all around.\\\" Nevertheless, detractors of the show, such as John Walters of Newsweek, criticized Fallon for his weakness in interviews. One writer for Conan, a fellow late-night show, criticized Fallon for creating what he dubbed \\\"Prom King Comedy\\\"--eschewing odder, more clever material for an over-reliance on games and celebrity cameos. Rolling Stone's Rob Sheffield opined that Fallon's effect led the medium to become overly friendly.\\n\\n\\n=== Ratings ===\\nThe debut episode of The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon averaged a 3.8 rating in adults 18-49 and 11.31 million viewers overall in Nielsen's fast-national estimates. This made it the second-largest audience for The Tonight Show since May 2009, behind Leno's final farewell two weeks earlier and the transition to Conan O'Brien nearly five years prior. The program's first full week averaged 8.490 million viewers, making it the franchise's most-watched week in 20 years. Following its premiere, The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon has consistently won its timeslot in ratings, routinely beating Late Show with David Letterman and Jimmy Kimmel Live!. Despite this, the ratings for competitors never significantly fell, with Fallon winning due to a surge in younger viewers. In his first year as host, Fallon's Tonight Show improved on ratings delivered by his predecessor Jay Leno.The series' post-Super Bowl episode in 2015 averaged 9.8 million viewers despite its late 12:13 a.m. start time. The following week's shows from Los Angeles maintained its highest ratings since its premiere. The show fell to second place on the debut night of The Late Show with Stephen Colbert that September, though it quickly rebounded and has remained in first place. In 2016, a New York Times study of the 50 TV shows with the most Facebook Likes found that Tonight \\\"is more popular in cities than in the surrounding countryside\\\".However, beginning in early 2017, The Tonight Show lost total viewership to The Late Show with Stephen Colbert for sixteen consecutive weeks beginning from the week of inauguration of Donald Trump, and also marked the first time that The Late Show with Stephen Colbert became the highest-rated late-night TV show by total viewership. Despite this loss, The Tonight Show led in the 18-49 year old demographic. The Late Show with Stephen Colbert became the highest-rated late-night talk show for the September 2016 to May 2017 season, averaging 3.2 million nightly viewers, beating The Tonight Show. His ratings fall has been ascribed to his pursuit of \\\"broad appeal rather than political criticism\\\" on divisive issues.\\n\\n\\n== Awards and nominations ==\\n\\n\\n=== Primetime Emmy Awards ===\\n\\n\\n=== Creative Arts Emmy Awards ===\\n\\n\\n== Effect ==\\nMuch like Fallon's preceding tenure on Late Night, many clips of the show have been made available on YouTube, Facebook, and other services shortly after its television broadcast. Many clips have gone on to become viral videos, which, along with widely viewed videos from competitor Jimmy Kimmel Live!, had an effect on the entire state of late-night television. Media pundits have predicted that future programs' accessibility online will be more important than their television ratings. David Letterman, a thirty-year veteran of the format who was the first host of Late Night and then hosted Late Show on CBS until 2015, partly retired due to his inability to produce viral bits.On October 27, 2015, it was announced that the attraction Twister...Ride it Out at Universal Studios Florida would be closing on November 2, 2015 to make room for Race Through New York Starring Jimmy Fallon, a ride based on Fallon's Tonight Show, which opened on April 6, 2017.\\n\\n\\n== Broadcast ==\\nIn Australia, The Tonight Show premiered on The Comedy Channel on February 18, 2014 - airing the same day as its U.S. broadcast.

Additionally, \\\"These Walls\\\" won Best Rap/Sung Collaboration.\\n\\n\\n== Background ==\\nOn February 28, 2014, Kendrick Lamar first revealed the plans to release a follow-up to his second studio album, Good Kid, M.A.A.D City (2012), during an interview with Billboard. In an interview with Rolling Stone, he was quoted as saying, \\\"Just putting the word 'pimp' next to 'butterfly'... It's a trip. That's something that will be a phrase forever. It'll be taught in college courses--I truly believe that.\\\" In an interview with MTV, Lamar said: \\\"To Pimp a Caterpillar was the original name and they caught it because the abbreviation was Tupac, Tu-P-A-C. Me changing it to Butterfly, I just really wanted to show the brightness of life and the word 'pimp' has so much aggression and that represents several things. For me, it represents using my celebrity for good. Another reason is, not being pimped by the industry through my celebrity.\\\" The album was at one point believed by many to be called Return of Enoch. Between the releases of Good Kid, M.A.A.D City and To Pimp a Butterfly, Lamar traveled to South Africa. Touring the country -- visiting historic sites such as Nelson Mandela's jail cell on Robben Island, heavily influenced the direction of the record.The album continues a nuanced dialogue about weighty topics that affect the African-American community. Releasing his album in a time of renewed black activism, Lamar's song \\\"Alright\\\" has become a rallying cry for the Black Lives Matter movement. With lyrics like \\\"and we hate po-po / Wanna kill us dead in the street fo sho,\\\" He makes it clear that he is supportive of the movement and the families of black men and women like Mike Brown, Sandra Bland, and Tamir Rice who have fallen victim to police brutality in the United States. Lamar takes his opinions further to lend his position on black on black crime in the song \\\"The Blacker the Berry\\\". He criticizes himself and his community by rapping, \\\"So why did I weep when Trayvon Martin was in the street? / When gang banging make me kill a nigga blacker than me?\\\" Some critics claim that his attitude facilitates the rhetoric that silences the Black Lives Matter movement. Stereo Williams of The Daily Beast wrote in response to his lyrics that \\\"it's dangerous to use that violence as a silencing tactic when the public is angry about the systematic subjugation of black people.\\\"\\n\\n\\n== Recording and production ==\\nTo Pimp a Butterfly was recorded from 2012 to 2015 at a variety of studios; including Chalice Recording Studios, Downtown Studios, House Studios, Notifi Studios and No Excuses Studios. Lamar wrote the lyrics to the song \\\"Mortal Man\\\", while on Kanye West's Yeezus Tour. During the whole tour, producer Flying Lotus played Lamar a selection of tracks that was intended for Captain Murphy's album (Flying Lotus's alter ego). Lamar kept all the tracks, but only opener \\\"Wesley's Theory\\\", which also features Thundercat and George Clinton, made the final cut onto the album. Lotus had produced a version of \\\"For Sale? (Interlude)\\\" that was ultimately discarded, with Lamar using Taz Arnold's version of the song on the album instead. Lotus stated that it is unlikely his version of the song will see a release. American rapper Rapsody appeared on the album, contributing a verse to the song \\\"Complexion (A Zulu Love)\\\". Lamar had requested that 9th Wonder contact Rapsody and request her appearance. Rapsody and Lamar discussed the song but there was little instruction from Lamar regarding her contribution. Speaking about the song, she stated that Lamar had already decided on the concept of the song and stated that the only instructions he gave were the song's title and the idea that \\\"...we are beautiful no matter our race but he really wanted to speak to our people and address this light versus dark complex\\\".\\n\\nIn 2014, Pharrell Williams, who previously worked with Lamar, along with producer Sounwave, played the \\\"Alright\\\"-track at the Holy Ship Festival. The track features the same unidentified sample that Williams used on Rick Ross' track \\\"Presidential\\\" from his album God Forgives, I Don't (2012). Reportedly, at one time it featured a guest appearance from American rapper Fabolous. The album went through three different phases before the production team could move forward with the idea. Afterwards, producer Thundercat was brought into the process, after Flying Lotus brought him along to see Lamar's performance on The Yeezus Tour. The album's lead single, titled \\\"i\\\", was produced by Rahki, who also produced a song for the album entitled \\\"Institutionalized\\\". Although the version of \\\"i\\\" appearing on the album is drastically different from that on the single release, both versions contained a sample of the song \\\"That Lady\\\" performed by The Isley Brothers. Lamar personally visited The Isley Brothers', to receive permission from lead vocalist Ronald Isley to sample the song.Lamar began traveling to St. Louis and began working with Isley at the studio. Isley also performed on the song \\\"How Much a Dollar Cost\\\" alongside the singer-songwriter James Fauntleroy. Producer and rapper Pete Rock provided some backing vocals and scratches to the song \\\"Complexion (A Zulu Love)\\\", and as he stated, the contribution was unusual, as he was not the producer for the track. Singer Bilal features on the songs \\\"Institutionalized\\\" and \\\"These Walls\\\", and has provided un-credited backing vocals on the songs \\\"u\\\", \\\"For Sale? (Interlude)\\\", \\\"Momma\\\" and \\\"Hood Politics\\\". Bilal stated that he and Lamar were initially unsure of how many songs he would be featured on, stating he worked on various tracks, but did not yet know the outcome. \\\"For a lot of the material, Kendrick had a idea of what he wanted. He would sing out the melody and some of the words, and I would interpret what he was telling me.\\\" On the songs where Bilal added backing vocals, he stated that \\\"...some of it was freestyle; just adding color to make it a fuller sound.\\\" Lamar also reportedly worked with American musician Prince, however, the duo were too pressed for time during the recording session and therefore were unable to complete any work for inclusion on the album. Lamar professed to having listened often to Miles Davis and Parliament-Funkadelic during the album's recording.In 2016, Lamar released Untitled Unmastered, a compilation album, which contains previously unreleased demos that originated during the recording of To Pimp a Butterfly. According to producer Thundercat, it \\\"completes the sentence\\\" of Lamar's third studio album.The booklet included with To Pimp a Butterfly's CD version was produced with braille letterings, which when translated reveal, according to Lamar, the \\\"actual full title of the album.\\\" Complex commissioned a braille translator, who found that it literally translated to A Kendrick by Letter Blank Lamar which Complex noted was most likely supposed to read as A Blank Letter by Kendrick Lamar.\\n\\n\\n== Music and lyrics ==\\nStereogum described To Pimp a Butterfly as an \\\"ambitious avant-jazz-rap statement,\\\" while Billboard categorized it as a \\\"politically-charged\\\" conscious rap album, and The Source categorized the album as an experimental hip hop release. Lamar described the release as an \\\"honest, fearful and unapologetic\\\" work that draws on funk, hard bop, spoken word and soul while critics also noted elements of West Coast hip hop and the avant-garde. Kyle Anderson of Entertainment Weekly described the album as \\\"embracing the entire history of black American music.\\\" Dan Weiss of Spin noted \\\"shades of Miles Davis' On the Corner and free jazz all over [...], as well as Sly Stone's There's a Riot Goin' On and Funkadelic and Erykah Badu's similarly wah-crazy but comparatively lo-fi New Amerykah (4th World War),\\\" but stated nonetheless that \\\"the sense of this album is vividly contemporary.\\\" Greg Kot of Chicago Tribune also noted the album's affinities with previous black music, but argued that \\\"Lamar takes familiar musical tropes into new territory.\\\" The Atlantic noted the influence of collaborator Flying Lotus, writing that \\\"his signature sound--jazz instrumentation and hip-hop layered into chaotic collages--is all over the album.\\\" Steve Mallon of The Quietus noted an \\\"eerily warped psychedelia bursting out of its idiosyncratic arrangements.\\\"The album's lyrics explore a variety of political and personal themes related to race, culture, and discrimination. Critic Neil Kulkarni said it appraises \\\"the broken promises and bloody pathways in and out of America's heartland malaise\\\". In an interview with MTV, Kendrick discussed the meaning behind the tracks \\\"Wesley's Theory\\\" and \\\"King Kunta\\\". The album's opening track, \\\"Wesley's Theory\\\", is a reference to Wesley Snipes and how the actor was jailed for tax evasion. In the interview Lamar stated that \\\"no one teaches poor black males how to manage money or celebrity, so if they do achieve success, the powers that be can take it from right under them\\\". \\\"King Kunta\\\" is concerned with the \\\"history of negative stereotypes all African-Americans have to reconcile\\\". Lamar also explained his criticism of rappers who use ghostwriters on \\\"King Kunta\\\", revealing that he came to prominence as a ghostwriter, and has respect for writers, but says that \\\"as a new artist, you have to stand behind your work.\\\"\\\"These Walls\\\" has been described by Billboard as \\\"pondering sex and existence in equal measure; it's a yoni metaphor about the power of peace, with sugar walls being escape and real walls being obstacles.\\\" Lamar revealed that \\\"u\\\" was inspired by his own experience of depression and suicidal thoughts. He also mentioned feelings of survivor's guilt as inspirations for the album. \\\"Alright\\\" begins as a spoken-word treatise before exploding into a shapeshifting portrait of America that brings in jazz horns, skittering drum beats and Lamar's mellifluous rapping as he struggles with troubles and temptations. Yet at the end of each verse, he reassures himself that \\\"We gon' be alright\\\"--a simple rallying cry for a nation reeling from gun violence and police brutality. For critics a \\\"celebration of being alive\\\", Lamar described \\\"Alright\\\" as a message of hope. \\\"The Blacker the Berry\\\" features a \\\"boom bap beat\\\" and lyrics that celebrate Lamar's African-American heritage and \\\"tackle hatred, racism, and hypocrisy head on.\\\" The song's hook is performed by Jamaican dancehall artist Assassin, notable for performing on Kanye West's 2013 LP Yeezus, whose lyrics similarly address racial inequality, specifically against African Americans.\\n\\n\\n== Release and promotion ==\\nTo Pimp a Butterfly was first released to the iTunes Store and Spotify on March 15, 2015, eight days ahead of its scheduled release date. According to Anthony Tiffith, CEO of Top Dawg Entertainment, the album's early release was unintentional, apparently caused by an error on the part of Interscope Records. The following day, it was made unavailable on iTunes, and the release was rescheduled for March 23, although it was still available for streaming on Spotify. To Pimp a Butterfly debuted at number one on record charts in the United Kingdom, Australia, and the United States, where it sold 324,000 copies in its first week. The album was streamed 9.6 million times in its first day on Spotify, setting the service's global first-day streaming record. It reached sales of one million copies worldwide at the end of 2015. By March 2016, it had sold 850,000 copies in the US, where it was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). As of June 2017, it has sold one million copies in the country.The album's release was preceded by the release of two singles, \\\"i\\\", on September 23, 2014, and \\\"The Blacker the Berry\\\" in February 2015. The former became Lamar's sixth top-40 single on the US Billboard Hot 100 and was performed on Saturday Night Live. Following the album release, \\\"King Kunta\\\" was released as the third single in March 2015, and \\\"Alright\\\" was released to radio stations on June 30. With its release, several contemporary progressive news outlets, including BET, raised the idea of \\\"Alright\\\" being the modern Black National Anthem, while the media reported youth-lead protests against police brutality across the country chanting the chorus of the song. Primarily for the latter, Lamar was featured on Ebony Power 100, an annual list that recognizes many leaders of the African-American community. \\\"These Walls\\\" was released as the album's fifth single on October 13.Aside from the singles' accompanying music videos, the song \\\"For Free? (Interlude)\\\" also featured visuals, as did \\\"u\\\" with \\\"For Sale? (Interlude)\\\" as part of the short film God Is Gangsta. In October 2015, Lamar announced the Kunta's Groove Sessions Tour, which included eight shows in eight cities.\\n\\n\\n== Critical reception ==\\nTo Pimp a Butterfly was met with widespread critical acclaim. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 96, based on 44 reviews. Spin magazine's Dan Weiss hailed it as the \\\"Great American Hip-Hop Album\\\" and an essential listen, while Neil McCormick from The Daily Telegraph called it a dense but dazzling masterpiece. Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Kyle Anderson found the record twice as substantial as Lamar's debut major label album and more comprehensive of African-American music styles, with supremely \\\"cinematic\\\" production qualities but \\\"the freedom of a mixtape\\\". Irish Times journalist Jim Carroll deemed it \\\"a record for the times we're in\\\", in which Lamar transitioned from his past narratives about Compton to fierce but precise reflections on \\\"black America\\\". In Rolling Stone, Greg Tate deemed To Pimp a Butterfly \\\"a masterpiece of fiery outrage, deep jazz and ruthless self-critique\\\" that along with D'Angelo's third album Black Messiah, made 2015 \\\"the year radical Black politics and for-real Black music resurged in tandem to converge on the nation's pop mainstream.\\\" Robert Christgau wrote in his review on Cuepoint that not many artists were as passionate and understanding as Lamar, who offered \\\"a strong, brave effective bid to reinstate hip hop as black America's CNN\\\" during an era of social media. New York Times critic Jon Caramanica was less enthusiastic, feeling Lamar still struggled in reconciling his density as a lyricist with the music he rapped over: \\\"He hasn't outrun his tendency towards clutter [and] still runs the risk of suffocation.\\\" In The Guardian, Alexis Petridis found the music somewhat erratic and lamented \\\"moments of self-indulgence\\\" such as the twelve-minute \\\"Mortal Man\\\" and Lamar's reflections on fame.At the end of 2015, To Pimp a Butterfly was the most frequently ranked record in top ten lists of the year's best albums. According to Metacritic, it appeared 101 times in the top ten of lists published by critics, magazines, websites, and music stores. The record topped 51 lists, including those by Rolling Stone, Billboard, Pitchfork, Slant Magazine, Spin, The Guardian, Complex, Consequence of Sound, The Irish Times, and Vice. NME ranked it second on their list, while Time named it the year's third best album. It was voted the best album of 2015 in the Pazz & Jop, an annual poll of American critics nationwide, published by The Village Voice. Christgau, the Pazz & Jop's creator, ranked it fourth in his ballot for the poll. The album placed ninth in British magazine The Wire's annual critics' poll.To Pimp a Butterfly also earned Lamar 11 nominations at the 58th Grammy Awards, which was the most nominations for any rapper in a single night. It was nominated in the categories of Album of the Year and Best Rap Album, winning the latter. \\\"Alright\\\" won for Best Rap Performance and Best Rap Song while also being nominated for Song of the Year and Best Music Video. \\\"These Walls\\\" won for Best Rap/Sung Performance. At the previous year's ceremony, \\\"i\\\" had won Grammy Awards for Best Rap Song and Best Rap Performance. To Pimp a Butterfly also received a nomination for Top Rap Album at the 2016 Billboard Music Awards.According to Gigwise writer Will Butler, To Pimp a Butterfly was universally hailed by critics as an \\\"instant classic\\\" and its immediate influence was felt as \\\"a pantheon for racial empowerment\\\". Of its long-term impact, Butler argued that the record helped create a respected space for conscious hip hop and \\\"will be revered not just at the top of some list at the end of the year, but in the subconscious of music fans for decades to come\\\". With the album, Aaron Williams of Uproxx said \\\"Lamar proved that left-field, experimental rap can function in both the critical and commercial realms\\\". To Pimp a Butterfly was an influence on David Bowie's 2016 album Blackstar. As producer its Tony Visconti recalled, he and Bowie were \\\"listening to a lot of Kendrick Lamar ... we loved the fact Kendrick was so open-minded and he didn't do a straight-up hip-hop record. He threw everything on there, and that's exactly what we wanted to do.\\\"\\n\\n\\n== Academic reception ==\\nTo Pimp a Butterfly has been subject to a number of scholarly treatments from academic areas including history, critical race theory, religion, musicology, and psychology.\\nCalifornia State University, Fullerton professor Natalie Graham compared To Pimp a Butterfly to the television miniseries Roots. She argued that while \\\"Roots compresses and simplifies\\\" black history, To Pimp a Butterfly \\\"radically disrupt[s] meanings of black respectability, heroic morality, trauma, and memory.\\\" Will Fulton, a musicologist, wrote in the American Music Review that To Pimp a Butterfly - like D'Angelo's 2014 album, Black Messiah - engages in and celebrates the black music tradition. Fulton described Lamar and D'Angelo as \\\"consciously index[ing] African American musical styles of the past in a dynamic relationship of nostalgic revivalism and vanguardism.\\\"In the Toronto Journal of Theology, James D. McLeod Jr. drew parallels between Lamar's examination of death's domineering significance in the African-American experience and the works of Christian theologian Paul Tillich, with McLeod calling To Pimp a Butterfly an original example of \\\"existentialist hip hop.\\\" Meanwhile, Adam Blum discerned connections between To Pimp a Butterfly and the writings of psychoanalysts such as Wilfred Bion, Nicolas Abraham, and Sigmund Freud. In an essay published in The Lancet Psychiatry, University of Cambridge professors Akeem Sule and Becky Inkster described Lamar as the \\\"street poet of mental health,\\\" noting how To Pimp a Butterfly (as well as its predecessor, Good Kid, M.A.A.D City) explore topics such as addiction, anxiety, depression, and resilience.\\n\\n\\n== Track listing ==\\nCredits adapted from the album's liner notes.\\nNotes\\n^[a]  signifies an additional producer\\n\\\"Wesley's Theory\\\" features background vocals by Dr. Dre, Anna Wise, Ash Riser, Josef Leimberg and Whitney Alford\\n\\\"For Free?

The block grew out of Cartoon Network's previous attempts at airing content appropriate for teenagers and young adults who might be watching the channel after 11 pm (ET/PT). The network began experimenting with its late night programming by airing anthology shows like ToonHeads, The Bob Clampett Show, The Tex Avery Show, Late Night Black and White, and O Canada, which all presented uncensored classic cartoon shorts, as well as blocks such as Toonami Midnight Run. In numerous interviews, it had been stated that at the time, one third of Cartoon Network's audience were adults.During the 1990s, prime time animation geared at adults started growing popular due to the success of Fox's hit show The Simpsons. This was followed by a trend of other adult-oriented animated shows throughout the decade, such as: Liquid Television, Beavis and Butt-Head, Aeon Flux, The Brothers Grunt, Duckman, The Critic, The Maxx, King of the Hill, Daria, South Park, Space Ghost Coast to Coast, Dr. Katz, Professional Therapist, Futurama, The Oblongs, Clerks: The Animated Series, Dilbert, Mission Hill, Home Movies, and Family Guy, and more; as well as more general-oriented animated series such as The Powerpuff Girls, Dexter's Laboratory, The Ren & Stimpy Show, Animaniacs, Rocko's Modern Life, The Angry Beavers, Johnny Bravo, Dragon Ball Z, Pokemon, and SpongeBob SquarePants, among others, that garnered strong adult followings.\\nSpace Ghost Coast to Coast, Cartoon Network's first foray into original programming, was created in 1994 specifically for late night adult audiences. The series was created by Mike Lazzo's Ghost Planet Industries, which eventually became Williams Street Studios, the eventual producers and programmers of Adult Swim.Between 4:00 am and 5:00 am on December 21, and December 30, 2000 (while Space Ghost Coast to Coast was on hiatus), several new Williams Street series made unannounced \\\"stealth\\\" premieres. Sealab 2021, Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law, Aqua Teen Hunger Force and The Brak Show all premiered unannounced; the official schedules listed the shows as \\\"Special Programming\\\". Prior to that, in Entertainment Weekly, it was stated that Michael Ouweleen's next project was working on the Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law Pilot with J.J. Sedelmaier. In a 1999 interview, the indie pop rock band Calamine stated they had recorded the theme song for Sealab 2021. While entertaining pitches for a variety of adult cartoons, Lazzo realized the potential for packaging them as a complete adult-focused block. Different names were considered, including \\\"ibiso\\\", which was said to be Spanish for \\\"stop\\\", and \\\"Parental Warning\\\", but he eventually settled on \\\"Adult Swim\\\".\\nIn June 2001, TV Guide had recorded an interview with Cartoon Network's former president, Betty Cohen. She stated there was a new programming block coming out in September that was aimed for an adult audience. During this month at the Cartoon Network Confidential, \\\"Cartoon Network's best originals and outrageous animated shorts for discriminating adults\\\" in New York City, an upcoming episode of Space Ghost Coast to Coast titled \\\"Kentucky Nightmare\\\", the stealth pilots from December, Captain Linger, and an episode of Home Movies were screened for free. The screening was part of the Toyota Comedy Festival. On Saturday, July 21, 2001, the Space Ghost Coast to Coast panel at San Diego Comic Con had a trivia game in which the winners won a promotional CD that had the theme songs to the upcoming Adult Swim Shows. Everybody who attended got a free Adult Swim t-shirt that was packaged to look like a roll of bandages that a lifeguard might carry.At the Comic Con, audiences got to see clips of the upcoming shows and vote for what show they wanted to see as a sneak peek. Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law was the winner and the pilot was screened. The Leave It to Brak episode \\\"War Next Door\\\" and Space Ghost Coast to Coast episode \\\"The Justice Hole\\\" were also screened, as well as clips to the episode \\\"Sweet for Brak\\\". In an interview on creativemac.com on July 25, 2001, J.J. Sedelmaier talked about working on the Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law pilot. On August 12, the very first commercial advertising the new block aired on Cartoon Network. Around this time a press kit came out that featured towels and a promotional CD. Another press kit that was designed as a first aid kit came with a promo VHS with info on all the shows. Access Hollywood also highlighted the upcoming premieres. Print ads were shown in an August issue of Entertainment Weekly. On August 31, Adult Swim.com officially launched.\\n\\n\\n=== 2001-03 ===\\n\\nAdult Swim officially launched on Sunday, September 2, 2001, at 10 PM (EST), with the original debut airing of the Home Movies episode \\\"Director's Cut\\\", which had been shelved before airing on its original network, UPN. According to Linda Simensky, \\\"We had a bunch of episodes to screen for Mike Lazzo and by only the second episode, he yelled, Buy it!\\\" Cartoon Network bought the original five UPN episodes and ordered eight more to complete the season. The series' first season was animated in Squigglevision, however, the later seasons were done in flash animation. The first anime broadcast on the block also aired on the night of its launch, Cowboy Bebop. Aqua Teen Hunger Force debuted on the block on September 9, with the episode \\\"Escape from Leprechaupolis\\\". The block initially aired on Sunday nights from 10:00 pm to 1:00 am ET, with a repeat of the same block on Thursday nights.\\nAdult Swim had a disclaimer that read \\\"Parents strongly cautioned--the following programs are intended for mature audiences over the age of 18. These programs may contain some material that many parents would not find suitable for children and may include intense violence, sexual situations, coarse language and suggestive dialogue.\\\"Adult Swim's original bumpers shown in-between the shows featured footage of elderly people swimming in public pools, eating, exercising, and doing other pool-related activities. It would show signs all around the pool saying things like \\\"Warning Potential Violence\\\", \\\"Warning Strong Language in use\\\", \\\"Caution Sexual Innuendo\\\", \\\"Caution Limited Animation\\\", \\\"No Diving\\\", \\\"No Kids\\\", \\\"Warning Adult Situations\\\", and more. Some of these bumpers were narrated by a lifeguard who spoke through a megaphone. Most notably he would shout \\\"All kids out of the pool\\\". The logo was the words \\\"Adult Swim\\\" in all capital letters, shown after a freeze frame of the footage. Sometimes they were even shown in reverse. The block's original theme music, titled \\\"D-Code,\\\" was a remix of \\\"Mambo Gallego\\\" done by the Melbourne musician Dust Devil, originally played by Latin jazz musician Tito Puente, Sr. When the programs were shown on TV, in the right corner of the screen big red letters would say Adult Swim. The next year, the lettering was changed to white letters. Some of the bumps on the block included, Aqua Man Dance Party that featured a cartoon Aqua Man dancing in front of live action landfill footage, Captain Linger, a series of shorts created by J. J. Sedelmaier, Watering Hole, a series of shorts about animals talking in a bar created by Soup2Nuts, 1960s Hanna-Barbera action cartoons dubbed with the voices of children, a series of shorts called Not for Air that had the speech of Hanna-Barbera characters bleeped to make it seem like the characters were swearing, The New Adventures of The Wonder Twins, What They're Really Thinking, which had a voice narrate a character's thoughts in a comedic way, and Brak Puppet Party, a puppet show featuring classic Hanna-Barbera characters. Commercials starring characters from Aqua Teen Hunger Force, The Brak Show, Space Ghost Coast to Coast, Harvey Birdman, Attorney At Law, and Sealab 2021 started to appear as well such as 1-800-CALL-ATT, Nestea, Dr Pepper, Coca-Cola, Dodge Ram, Quizno's Sub, Maximum Hair Dye, Verizon Wireless and movie promos for Austin Powers in Goldmember, Kung Pow Enter the Fist, Eight Legged Freaks and The PowerPuff Girls Movie. Brak would also host a segment called Adult Swim News. Due to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, episodes of Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law, Cowboy Bebop, and Aqua Teen Hunger Force were delayed. In the winter of 2001 another Adult Swim CD was made available for free to anyone who purchased issue 28 of Hitch Magazine and the same CD came with issue 29. When the Saturday night block debuted on February 23, 2002, it was known as Adult Swim Action. Various anime programs displayed on the block from 11:00 pm to 2:00 am ET. This was divided between Adult Swim Action and Adult Swim Comedy. Adult Swim Comedy was Sunday nights and ran from 10:00 pm to 1:00 am ET. At this point, Adult Swim stopped airing on Thursday nights. The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show and The Popeye Show took Cowboy Bebop's place for 12:00 am and 12:30 am ET. On June 15, 2002, Adult Swim had their first contest called \\\"Adult Swim Happiness Sweepstakes\\\" where winners could win a Master Shake air freshener.\\n\\nIt would become increasingly common for Adult Swim to act as a home for reruns of animated series that had been cancelled prematurely, such as Home Movies, Family Guy, Futurama, Mission Hill, Baby Blues, The Ripping Friends, The Oblongs, and God, the Devil and Bob, as well as burn off remaining episodes of said shows that never aired on their original networks, as a result of their premature cancellation. The block obtained Futurama's exclusive cable syndication rights in September 2001 for a reported $10 million, and the series first aired on the network on January 12, 2003. Family Guy premiered on Adult Swim on April 20, 2003, debuting with the episode \\\"Brian in Love\\\", and immediately became the block's top-rated program, dominating late night viewing in its time period vs. cable and broadcast competition and boosting viewership of both the block, and Cartoon Network itself, by 239 percent. (Seth MacFarlane had previously created Larry and Steve, a cartoon predecessor to Family Guy,  that was aired on Cartoon Network's What a Cartoon! Show in 1997. MacFarlane had also worked on several Cartoon Network shows, such as Johnny Bravo and Dexter's Laboratory).\\nOn New Year's Eve 2002, Brak from The Brak Show and Carl Brutananadilewski from Aqua Teen Hunger Force hosted a New Year's Eve special from 11:00 pm to 3:00 am This was the first time Adult Swim aired on a Tuesday night.\\nOn January 12, 2003, the senior citizen bumpers were replaced by animated safety manuals featuring Adult Swim characters. The logo was changed to the words \\\"adult swim\\\" in red and a black circle with a yellow penumbra. Beginning on January 13, 2003, Adult Swim was airing five nights a week, Sundays through Thursdays from 11:00 pm to 2:00 am. Saturday Nights were dropped. On February 9, 2003, after the NBA All-Star game, Adult Swim aired on the TNT Network on a block called \\\"Adult Swim All Star Extravaganza\\\" as a one time special from 11:00 pm to 12:15 am ET.\\n\\n\\n=== 2003-14 ===\\n\\nNew bumps debuted on May 25, 2003, and feature black intertitle \\\"cards\\\" in white Helvetica Neue Condensed Bold type. The cards discuss everything from programming news to personal staff opinions on unrelated subjects. In addition, the bumpers for the action shows include tilt-shift miniature and other abstract photos of Japan, often accompanied by clips of various Yesterdays New Quintet songs. The most recent bumper cards have the \\\"[adult swim]\\\" or \\\"[as]\\\" caption somewhere within photographs of places - often with roads or road signs throughout the world. One of the more infamous bumps was \\\" cus anime is teh s uck\\\"; this started because of someone on the Adult Swim message board complaining about the anime programming on the block, and because the message board wouldn't allow the word \\\"sucks\\\" to be written, Adult Swim turned it into a running gag and sold T-shirts with the phrase written on it.At certain times during the evening, the bumps will give a programming lineup for an upcoming date. When this format is given, certain shows will be given a specified color (indicating a premiere), with a caption at the bottom that reads \\\"All Times and Music Eastern\\\". The music in the background has a decidedly Indian flair.On June 26, 2003, Spike TV aired its own adult animation block called \\\"The Strip\\\" airing Ren & Stimpy \\\"Adult Party Cartoon\\\", Stripperella and Gary the Rat. On October 2, 2003, the television program VH1 Goes Inside had an episode about Adult Swim. On October 5, 2003 Adult Swim was on from 11:00 pm to 5:00 am ET. On October 26, 2003, Brak's Dad from The Brak Show hosted Halloween-themed bumps. That same night, Adult Swim hosted a live webcam show on its website, featuring the Adult swim staff having a party. The Big O series finale episode \\\"The Show Must Go On\\\", was supposed to premiere that night at 11:00 pm, however, Adult Swim had to reschedule the episode for the next week, on Sunday, November 2, taking the place of the scheduled previously unaired episode of Family Guy,  \\\"When You Wish Upon a Weinstein\\\", upsetting many fans. The Family Guy episode had to air on November 9. When Big O premiered on November 2, a rerun episode, \\\"Stripes\\\" was airing but then Adult Swim said it was just a joke and they finally aired the correct episode.\\nAdult Swim had another New Year's Eve special, this time featuring some of the Adult Swim characters having a party at Brak's house celebrating the night. It was on this night where The Brak Show was officially cancelled. On June 15, 2004 Adult Swim started a Video on Demand. July 19, 2004, Adult Swim had a publicity stunt telling viewers that they needed 1,000,000 people to go to their website so they can \\\"Free Hockey Chicken\\\". An Adult Swim employee was dressed as a chicken in front of a webcam being watched by viewers and he could not leave the studio until they reached their goal. That same year Adult Swim hyped viewers by asking them to vote which would win in a fight a \\\"Flying Shark or a Flying Crocodile.\\\"In the fall of 2004, Adult Swim started a course at Kent State University with lessons by film professor Ron Russo, author of the book \\\"Adult Swim and Comedy\\\". On Halloween night in 2004, Phantasm actor Angus Scrimm hosted an Aqua Teen Hunger Force marathon. On November 2, 2004, Adult Swim ran a marathon of the Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law episode \\\"Guitar Control\\\" all through the night, until 5 a.m.. The episode replayed 24 times to celebrate Election Day. On November 28, Adult Swim had a week showing off classic bumps from previous years. On March 28, 2005, Atlanta-based Turner Broadcasting System began recording Adult Swim Nielsen ratings separately from Cartoon Network for demographic purposes. Promotions for Adult Swim are targeted towards the college age and those in their 20s and 30s, constituting the majority of their viewers. According to a September 1, 2004 article in Promo magazine, representatives travel to 30 universities across the U.S. to promote the Adult Swim lineup, including handing out posters for students' dorm rooms. On April 17, 2004, Adult Swim regained Saturday nights, making Friday the only night where Adult Swim did not air. On March 28, 2005, Adult Swim gained an extra hour, now ending at 6 a.m.. On October 2, 2005, Adult Swim regained the 10 p.m. hour on Sundays, continuing to start at 11 p.m. Mondays to Thursdays, and Saturdays.\\nAdult Swim had a direct and important role in the revival of an aforementioned popular animated series, Family Guy. Due to the series' popularity in reruns, the block burned off \\\"When You Wish Upon a Weinstein\\\", an episode of the series that had been banned from airing on Fox, in 2003. On September 21, 2003, Seth MacFarlane guest voiced on the Aqua Teen Hunger Force episode \\\"Super Trivia\\\". In 2004, from July 26 through July 29 Adult Swim had a week dedicated to Seth MacFarlane where It had him host a Family Guy marathon showing select episodes. On March 29, 2004, less than one year after beginning reruns on Adult Swim, Fox announced it would be renewing Family Guy for a fourth season and reviving it from cancellation. Shortly after the announcement, Jim Samples, then-general manager and executive vice president of Cartoon Network, commented, \\\"Bringing Family Guy to the Adult Swim lineup last April really helped turn the block into a cultural phenomenon with young adults.\\\"Futurama was also revived in 2007 by Comedy Central for similar reasons: impressive viewership in syndication as well as high DVD sales. In 2006, Twentieth Television struck a deal to produce four direct-to-video animated features based on Futurama, and, in 2009, the series was revived in normal half-hour installments beginning in 2010 on Comedy Central. In a 2006 interview, Futurama creator Matt Groening explained \\\"There's a long, regal history of misunderstood TV shows, and to Fox's credit, the studio looked at the ratings on the Cartoon Network and how the show does overseas, and saw that there was more money to be made.\\\" Before Adult Swim lost the rights to Futurama reruns, they aired an all-night marathon on December 31, 2007, thus, marking Futurama's end on the block. On New Year's Eve 2005, Adult Swim had a countdown for the new year featuring characters from their shows. Beginning on March 27, 2006 Adult Swim's time began at 10:30 pm ET weekdays.On January 31, 2007, Adult Swim attracted national media attention as part of the 2007 Boston Mooninite panic. Both the Boston Police Department and the Boston Fire Department mistakenly identified battery-powered LED placards resembling The Mooninites, characters from Aqua Teen Hunger Force, as improvised explosive devices. These devices were in fact part of a guerrilla marketing campaign for the Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters. The next day, Boston authorities arrested two men involved with the incident. Peter Berdovsky, 27, a freelance video artist from Arlington, Massachusetts, and Sean Stevens, 28, were facing charges of placing a hoax device to incite panic, as well as one count of disorderly conduct, according to CNN (which is also owned by Turner Broadcasting System).\\nOn February 5, Turner Broadcasting and marketer Interference, Inc. announced that they would pay $2 million in amends: one million to the city of Boston, and one million in goodwill funds. Four days later, on February 9, Jim Samples, general manager and Executive Vice President of Cartoon Network since 2001, resigned. Turner Broadcasting later issued an apology for the ad campaign that caused the bomb scares. A statement emailed to The Boston Globe from Turner Broadcasting said:\\n\\n\\\"The 'packages' in question are magnetic lights that pose no danger. They are part of an outdoor marketing campaign in 10 cities in support of Adult Swim's animated television show Aqua Teen Hunger Force. They had been in place for two to three weeks in Boston, New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston, Atlanta, Seattle, Portland, Austin, San Francisco, and Philadelphia. Parent company Turner Broadcasting is in contact with local and federal law enforcement on the exact locations of the billboards. We regret that they were mistakenly thought to pose any danger.\\\"\\nIn 2007, Adult Swim announced it would expand to seven nights a week starting that July. Up until then, it was only on Saturdays-Thursdays, with Cartoon Network airing 24 hours on Friday. On July 6 of that year, Adult Swim had its first broadcast on a Friday with an all-night marathon of Family Guy, with one episode, Peter's Two Dads, rerunning the April Fools gag of that year, running the first half-hour of Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film For Theaters in a small square on the bottom left hand corner.\\nOn January 1, 2009, Adult Swim began airing reruns of King of the Hill and its sign-on time was expanded by one hour, moving from 11 p.m. to 10 p.m. ET. On December 26, 2010, Adult Swim moved its start time from 10 p.m. to 9 p.m. ET, extending the network's daily schedule to nine hours.\\n\\n\\n=== 2014-present ===\\nOn March 31, 2014, Adult Swim re-branded their bumpers. From 8:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m. (ET/PT), the bumpers themselves include live action pans of landscapes, signs, objects, and animals with the Adult Swim logo embossed in them, sometimes hidden. The advisory sign-on bumper was changed from the traditional black and white text-only format to now feature various live action backgrounds similar to its non-advisory counterparts.\\nThe content warning message is \\\"[adult swim] may contain mature material some viewers may not find suitable\\\". Adult Swim still airs the traditional black and white bumpers and advisory bumpers from 11:00 p.m. to 5:00 a.m. (ET/PT) every day except Saturday night/Sunday morning, since Toonami aired then. Instead, the live shot identifications are shown.\\nOn March 31, 2014, Adult Swim's sign-on time was moved to 8:00 p.m. ET, further extending the network's daily schedule to ten hours and effectively matching the airtime of most nights that Nick at Nite has. Sometimes, Cartoon Network takes the 8:00 p.m. ET hour back, making Adult Swim start at 9:00 p.m. ET again. This has happened twice since 2014, from October 26 to November 29, 2015, and September 26 to December 5, 2016.\\nIn 2015, Adult Swim launched The Virtual Brainload, the first animated VR experience from a TV network.On May 7, 2015, it was announced that Adult Swim had ordered an untitled pilot by Million Dollar Extreme described as a \\\"sketch show in an almost present day post apocalyptic nightmare world\\\". Based on that pilot, it was announced on March 3, 2016, that it would go to series with the group presenting it under the additional subtitle World Peace, and the first season consisting of six episodes under the network's traditional eleven-minute episode structure. Adult Swim announced on December 5, 2016 that it would not be renewed for a second season; the network faced internal opposition to its continuation, mainly regarding accusations of MDE's documented connections to the alt-right and accusations that the show promoted racism, sexism and bigotry. While the show did not predominantly deal with political themes, Sam Hyde's Twitter feed containing political references and his other controversies like crashing a TEDx talk, added to the suspicion. Buzzfeed writer, Joseph Bernstein, was active in criticizing the show after a heated interview with the creator, Sam Hyde. He wrote that a source told him the network's standards departments repeatedly discovered and removed coded racist messages, including hidden swastikas. When asked, Hyde explained that despite Adult Swim executives' interest to pick up the show for a second season, Turner ultimately decided to cancel the show.In late November 2017, Adult Swim's programming switched from featuring Spanish language audio on the second audio program to Descriptive Video Service audio on Family Guy, Bob's Burgers and American Dad (which have their DVS done for their original runs on Fox and TBS).\\n\\n\\n== Special events ==\\n\\n\\n=== Death tributes ===\\nAdult Swim occasionally airs bumpers that pay tribute to a recent celebrity death, in which there is no music or sound effects, but only a fade-in, showing the person's name, along with the year of their birth and the year of their death, followed by a fade-out. This has been done for many celebrities, including Vincent Schiavelli, Macho Man Randy Savage, Elizabeth Taylor, Alex Toth, Harry Goz, Frank Buckles, Andy Griffith, Neil Armstrong, Johnny Cash, John Ritter, Farrah Fawcett, Michael Jackson, Gary Coleman, Richard Dunn, Steve Jobs, Leonard Nimoy, Yogi Berra, Prince, Jimmy \\\"Superfly\\\" Snuka, Charlie Murphy, Stephen Hawking and Aretha Franklin.\\nWhen news broke of the death of Space Ghost Coast to Coast voice actor and animator C. Martin Croker, who died on September 18, 2016, the network paid tribute to him by playing the first Coast to Coast episode in his memory that night. They also played a bump in his memory that talked about his work for Adult Swim, and then his name, year of birth, and year of death, with a slow fade in and fade out, like bumps for other deaths. This bump was 30 seconds, while most regular bumps are half of that time.\\n\\n\\n=== April Fools' Day stunts ===\\n\\nAdult Swim has an annual tradition of celebrating April Fools' Day by tricking and fooling their audience by altering programs or airing different and obscure programs.\\n\\nStarting in 2004, all of the regularly scheduled episodes were aired with random mustaches drawn on the characters; however, the next night the episodes were aired again this time without the random mustaches.\\nIn 2005, Adult Swim aired an early, unfinished version of the Squidbillies pilot, instead of Robot Chicken. Right after the rough cut, it was announced that the animated series would premiere later in October 2005.\\nIn 2006, Adult Swim aired old re-runs of Mr. T and Chuck Norris: Karate Kommandos, and then aired episodes of Fullmetal Alchemist and Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex with fart noises added to the dialog.\\nOn March 31, 2007, Adult Swim aired every episode of Perfect Hair Forever in reverse order. The episodes were digitally degraded to look like several generations-old videotapes with grammatically incorrect subtitles in Engrish. At one point, the subtitles shown on screen were actually for an Aqua Teen Hunger Force episode.\\nOn April 1, 2007, Adult Swim had been advertising that it would be airing Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters in its entirety on April Fools' Day. Technically, they made good on their promise by showing the first two minutes (which had long been available on the movie's website) full-screen and the entire rest of the film in a very small picture-in-picture window with its sound played over SAP during normal programming.\\nIn 2008, Adult Swim aired a night of unfinished sneak peeks, pilots and stealth premieres of future upcoming shows in place of its regularly scheduled programming, featuring Fat Guy Stuck in Internet, The Venture Bros., Delocated, Superjail!, Young Person's Guide to History, Metalocalypse, Robot Chicken, and Moral Orel. Some of these premieres included introductory segments hosted by Robert Osborne, from Turner Classic Movies. The repeat block did air the scheduled ATHF movie, with bumps teasing the viewer about missing the premieres.\\nIn 2009, Adult Swim aired The Room, a 2003 independent film that was considered a cult classic, with sex scenes obscured with black boxes. That was followed by the Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job! episode \\\"Tommy\\\", which featured the star and director of the film Tommy Wiseau.\\nIn 2010, Adult Swim re-aired The Room for a second year in a row, with bumps featuring Tommy Wiseau being interviewed on Space Ghost Coast to Coast. Sex scenes remained censored, but the parental rating was raised to TV-MA.\\nIn 2011, The Room was aired once again with the TV-MA rating and was followed by a 15-minute special titled Earth Ghost, a CGI version of the Lowe Country pilot shown on Adult Swim Video in 2007.\\nIn 2012, Adult Swim replaced its lineup with Toonami, a former programming block from Cartoon Network. After first playing the opening sequence of The Room, the scene switched to the Toonami host T.O.M. noting that it was April Fools' Day before introducing that week's scheduled episode of Bleach. The Toonami bumps and programming would continue throughout the night, featuring Dragon Ball Z, Mobile Suit Gundam Wing, Tenchi Muyo! Ryo-Ohki, Outlaw Star, The Big O season 1, Yu Yu Hakusho, Blue Submarine No. 6, Trigun, the original version of Astro Boy, and Gigantor. T.O.M. also presented a review of Mass Effect 3 and promoted the recent DVD releases of the series featured. Subsequently, on May 16, 2012, Adult Swim announced via Twitter and later by a press release that Toonami would return to Adult Swim on May 26, 2012, as a regular weekly Saturday night programming block.\\nIn 2013, Adult Swim featured images of cats throughout much of its programming. All of the bumps contained videos and images of cats, while the episodes of the live action shows aired that night had cat faces covering up the faces of the actors. The [adult swim] logo was replaced with \\\"[meow meow]\\\".\\nIn 2014, Adult Swim premiered an eighth episode of Perfect Hair Forever, seven years following the series finale. This was followed by an unannounced Space Ghost Coast to Coast marathon featuring creator-chosen episodes (including the full version of \\\"Fire Ant\\\", which has rarely been shown on TV). During the marathon, bumps were included between episodes showing outtakes and commentary from the writers and staff. The entire stunt was replayed all day the following day without advertisements on the adultswim.com website.\\nIn 2015, Adult Swim aired a selected marathon of Aqua Teen Hunger Force, with superimposed coins on the screen. That was a version of the \\\"Coin Hunt\\\" game from adultswim.com's streaming show FishCenter, in which the main characters of the show collected points by hovering over the coins during the episodes, which were counted and tabulated throughout the night. This stunt was paired with a 6-hour-long live broadcast of FishCenter, streaming from midnight till 6:00 a.m. eastern time on the Adult Swim website. The live all-nighter featured special guest Trixie Mattel, Zach White, a guitar music performance and several confused call-ins.\\nIn 2016, advertisements were shown for the April Fools' broadcast, recapping their 12-year history of pranks and hyping up that year's prank. When midnight did occur, regular programming played, with the implication being that the prank for 2016 was that there was no prank.\\nOn March 31, 2017, all the regularly scheduled episodes after midnight had a weird audio mix, including added laugh tracks, Seinfeld stings, robotic and pitch-shifted filters added to particular voices, various sound effects and alternate musical pieces.\\nOn April 1, 2017, in another rare two joke-fer, the evening portion of Adult Swim was replaced with the unannounced Rick and Morty Season 3 premiere. The episode \\\"The Rickshank Rickdemption\\\" aired repeatedly from 8pm until midnight on TV (shortening Toonami in the process and pre-empting premieres of Samurai Jack and Dragon Ball Super), and was also streaming on a loop on the adultswim.com streams all night. The bumps included new commissioned idents related to Rick and Morty and announcement promos of upcoming shows and seasons.\\nOn March 31, 2018, Toonami premiered the first episode of FLCL Alternative, the show's third season (even as the second season had not been aired yet), albeit in Japanese with English subtitles, breaking Toonami's policy of only playing dubbed anime. Following FLCL, the 2004 movie Mind Game, directed by Masaaki Yuasa, was played. Most of Toonami's scheduled programming for that night (featuring JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Stardust Crusaders, Hunter x Hunter, Naruto: Shippuden, Space Dandy, Cowboy Bebop & Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex 2nd Gig) were pushed back to 2:45 a.m. after the movie, and aired subbed instead of dubbed. The short Scavengers finished off the block at 5:45 a.m. The block aired special bumpers with TOM and SARA and a game review of Nier: Automata, all dubbed to Japanese with English subtitles and pink colors instead of the usual green. The Adult Swim logo was also changed to Japanese (stylized as [adarutosuimu]), affecting both bumps and the channel bug. Block runner Jason DeMarco confirmed on Twitter that all original scheduled programming that was affected by the English subtitled joke after Mind Game would air the same episode dubbed the following week.\\nOn April 1, 2018, in yet another rare two joke-fer, Adult Swim aired normally until 11:00 p.m., when it started airing an animated parody of Rick and Morty titled \\\"Bushworld Adventures\\\", created by Michael R. Cusack. It follows Rick and Morty in Australia going on wild adventures in search to find the green cube that was left at Bendigo. It looped three more times until midnight, pre-empting Rick and Morty and two Mike Tyson Mysteries reruns in the process. All of Adult Swim's nature-themed bumpers that aired throughout the hour were Australian themed. This special short was also simulcasted on a loop in a marathon stream on adultswim.com all night.\\n\\n\\n=== Alternate reality games ===\\n\\nAdult Swim began an ARG campaign on August 27, 2017 by airing a cryptic bump \\\"transmission\\\" during a new episode of Rick and Morty. The bump referred viewers to a Twitter account. Players were told that they were trying to rescue a stolen AI named Delilah. Weekly bumps provided puzzles to be solved by viewers with solutions submitted via Twitter. The solutions were then confirmed by both the Twitter account and subsequent bumps. Later in the game, Delilah was forced to self-destruct to prevent a security breach. The Twitter account then rebranded itself as a marketing company and claimed that the entire game was an experiment. Soon after this, a new Twitter account followed all the previous account's existing followers. This new account informed everyone that they were searching for their missing sister named Amelia. The bump transmissions then started referring viewers to this new Twitter account as well as several new Instagram accounts, continuing to provide puzzles that required solving. Some players have used Discord to work together as a team in a dedicated server to solve the puzzles and share theories about the game. The ARG has been consistently broadcasting new messages and puzzles every Sunday since the initial August 2017 broadcast, with only a short hiatus during the 2017 holiday break. On March 25, 2018 it was revealed that Amelia was safe and had been for quite some time. Players learned that Amelia's messages asking for help were actually sent 3 years prior and that their delay in being received was caused by time dilation. This revelation effectively completed the second chapter of the ARG, it also alluded to the next phase which has just started as of June 2018.\\n\\n\\n== Programming ==\\n\\nAdult Swim shows include The Venture Bros., Home Movies, Robot Chicken, Squidbillies, Metalocalypse, Moral Orel, Black Jesus, The Eric Andre Show, The Boondocks, Mr. Pickles, Superjail!, Black Dynamite, Rick and Morty, Soul Quest Overdrive,  Mike Tyson Mysteries, Loiter Squad, and Aqua Teen Hunger Force (also known by various alternative titles).

Some Cartoon Network programming has also aired on Adult Swim, such as Star Wars: The Clone Wars, Sym-Bionic Titan, the 2011 ThunderCats series & Samurai Jack.\\n\\n\\n== Merchandise and media offerings ==\\n\\n\\n=== Official website ===\\nAdult Swim's official website features adultswimtv.com (formerly Adult Swim Video), forum message boards (until late October 2016), online video games, music downloads, shopping (until April 16, 2012), mobile phone downloads, adult swim show sites, and the programming schedule for Adult Swim.\\n\\n\\n=== Online video streaming ===\\nBeginning in 2006, Adult Swim Video (originally named Adult Swim Fix upon launch) offered a free online video on demand service for recent and older episodes of a selection of its shows. In June 2010, they began delaying episode availability on Adult Swim Video by one week after original television broadcast. Previously, episodes had appeared 1-3 days after broadcast. In late 2012, the service was rebranded as \\\"adultswimtv.com\\\". Now, AdultSwim is available over a US portal at adultswim.com, a UK portal at adultswim.co.uk, and Australian programming is hosted by Nine Network.\\nIn August 2011, Adult Swim introduced Adult Swim Gold, a paywall available for cable and satellite subscribers with TV Everywhere authentication to see full episodes of Adult Swim programs. The selection of full episodes available on Adult Swim Video for public viewing without using Adult Swim Gold was greatly reduced from the prior offering. As of June 2014, the service has been combined with \\\"Watch [adult swim]\\\" (see also \\\"Live Stream in the United States\\\") with the latest episodes available only to subscribers.As of December 2013, over 30 online-exclusive shows are available on the website, including the long-running web series On Cinema and its spin-off Decker, which later became a TV series for Adult Swim.\\nIn 2014, Adult Swim began posting every episode of select shows online for permanent free viewing. However, some of the shows that had all their episodes available for free (Such as Sealab 2021, Harvey Birdman: Attorney at Law, and Moral Orel) have been removed as Hulu gained the rights to the shows, exclusively for Plus users. Around the same time, Adult Swim added a 24/7 live webcam to their official website that streams marathons of different shows all day long on a loop. Nowadays, there are multiple marathon streams; for Tim & Eric shows, Venture Bros. and Space Ghost Coast to Coast.\\n\\n\\n=== Video games ===\\nAdult Swim partnered with Midway Games in 2005 to begin development on video games based on Aqua Teen Hunger Force, Space Ghost Coast to Coast, The Brak Show and Sealab 2021.

Many of Adult Swim's bumps and packaging make use of instrumental and electronic music. Various music is also often borrowed from artists signed onto a wide array of different labels, including Warp Records and Ninja Tune Records.\\n\\n\\n=== Video on demand ===\\nIn mid-2004, Adult Swim launched a video on demand service on cable television providers, branded as \\\"Adult Swim Video\\\". The comedy section features several episodes from various Adult Swim original series, while the action section shows anime series and movies licensed by Bandai Entertainment, Geneon Entertainment, and Viz Media, some of which were never broadcast.

The site features a library of 1500 Adult Swim episodes and short video clips from various Adult Swim series.\\n\\n\\n=== Podcast ===\\nAdult Swim offered a video podcast on iTunes from March 21 to September 19, 2006. The podcasts featured behind-the-scenes segments of shows and exclusive content; such as an interview with Saved by the Bell's Dennis Haskins and a look at Brendon Small and Tommy Blacha's Metalocalypse. The podcast reached number two in iTunes' ranking of most downloaded podcasts.\\n\\n\\n=== Live Stream in the United States ===\\nBeginning on September 25, 2013 Turner Broadcasting System's The Cartoon Network Inc. began the live streaming of the Adult Swim channel through the Adult Swim mobile app and on the Adultswim.com Video on Demand service known as \\\"AS LIVE\\\". To access the live stream the user must be a subscriber to and log-in through their cable or satellite provider service account. Once authenticated the user can then select either the East or West Coast feeds to view the live feed which is optimized to play on both wireless Internet and cell data (i.e. 3G/4G) services.\\nCurrently the Watch Adult Swim service is available to subscribers of approximately 100 different cable and satellite providers including AT&T U-verse, Cablevision, Charter, Comcast Xfinity, Cox, DirecTV, Suddenlink and Verizon FiOS, and new cable providers are added frequently as needed.\\nUnlike its traditional broadcast counterpart, the AS Live internet stream does not show the same commercials.  This is primarily due to a contractual agreement between most American broadcast networks, including Turner owned properties, and the union SAG-AFTRA which represents television and radio performers and ASCAP and BMI which acts on behalf of music composers and performers for royalty payments. Under this agreement broadcast networks are required to pay a certain royalty fee to performers for commercials that they appeared in, provided voice-over or musical performance in. To usurp this Adult Swim broadcasts either a still card with a picture of an owl and the words \\\"Commercial Break, Stay Tuned\\\", Adult Swim program promos, or bumps made specifically for the stream.\\nThe Williams Stream produces original programming that air on weekdays from 10 AM to midnight:\\n\\nStupid Morning Bullshit: A morning talk show hosted by Sally Skinner and Jonothon Mitchell. The show discusses strange news stories and current events, occasionally interacting with the audience through games.\\nWilliams Street Swap Shop: A livestream phone-in trading show in the vein of tradio programs hosted by Zachary White and Matt Hutchinson. Audience members can call in to the show and offer items for trade. On Wednesdays, Zach hosts Wandering Wednesdays, where he travels out of the studio to take part in unique activities.\\nBloodfeast: Previously known as Crossword. A crossword puzzle solving show hosted by Maxime Simonet and Dave Bonawits in which viewers can call in to assist with answers. This show frequently uses surreal content intended to disturb viewers, including animations, poetry, and short films.\\nFishCenter Live: A parody of SportsCenter hosted by Maxime Simonet, Dave Bonawits, Matt Harrigan, and Andrew Choe narrating over a livestream of a tank of tropical fish. The hosts play games by overlaying images over the footage and scoring fish as they interact. Viewers can call in to interact with the hosts, give points to fish, or participate in games.\\nAssembly Line Yeah!: A show hosted by Jiyoung Lee and Anca Vlasan. The hosts make crafts like costumes, decorations, food, and more while talking to callers.\\nLast Stream on the Left: A podcast-style show hosted by Ben Kissel, Henry Zebrowski, and Marcus Parks. The hosts discuss dark or disturbing stories, conspiracy theories, and paranormal happenings.\\n\\n\\n=== Adult Swim Mobile & OTT App ===\\nSince its premiere in 2001 Adult Swim executives have worked extensively to extend the network's reach to viewers in venues outside of the normal cable and satellite television services, this includes the launch of the AdultSwim.com website and the release of apps for various mobile and Over-the-top platforms providing access to current and past Adult Swim programming, live marathons, live and pre-recorded original programs and the nightly online simulcast of the Adult Swim broadcast. Currently apps are available in the U.S. only for the Amazon Fire TV, Android (including Android TV), Apple TV, iOS, Chromecast, PlayStation Vue, Roku and Xbox One. Due to licensing agreements certain parts of the apps including access to the live stream and past shows require the viewer to use their cable, satellite and/or Sling TV or YouTube TV username and password to authenticate their right to access such content. A downside to these apps is the fact that unlike broadcast television they are not currently compliant with U.S. Closed captioning requirements.\\n\\n\\n== International ==\\n\\nAdult Swim has been actively expanding its reach across the world since 2005. As with the United States, the block airs in Canada, Australia, Russia, Brazil and the rest of Latin America. Other Cartoon Network markets choose not to air it due to local market conditions, licensing programs to other broadcasters or government content restrictions or regulations - such as Ofcom in the United Kingdom. In those markets, where regulation issues arise, the block is licensed to other networks or television stations instead.\\n\\n\\n=== Australia and New Zealand ===\\n\\nIn October 2013, Turner Broadcasting in partnership with MCM Media and Movideo launched a video on demand service Adult Swim Australia. The site features a library of 1500 Adult Swim episodes and short video clips from various Adult Swim series.\\nThe Australian and New Zealand version of Adult Swim was broadcast on Cartoon Network until December 31, 2007. Shows aired at that time were Aqua Teen Hunger Force, Sealab 2021, Space Ghost Coast to Coast, Harvey Birdman: Attorney at Law (which also aired on SBS), Tom Goes to the Mayor, Home Movies, The Venture Bros., and before its closure, Squidbillies. The comedy block aired every Friday and Saturday and an action block aired during the week, including mature anime like Cowboy Bebop, InuYasha, Bleach, Air Gear, Black Cat and Ghost in the Shell.\\nThe channel is no longer on Cartoon Network, but the comedy shows are now airing on The Comedy Channel in Australia.  The block returned on The Comedy Channel with Robot Chicken and Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law, in March 2008, with Aqua Teen Hunger Force joining the lineup on July 1. The Boondocks also airs on the same channel, although it is not under the Adult Swim banner and instead airs separately.\\nTo date, the Adult Swim lineup on The Comedy Channel has grown considerably with the block now airing every Saturday from 12 to 2 am AEST and 6:30 to 7:30 pm AEST to keep with the late night tradition of the former block. The new incarnation also premiered a lot of other Adult Swim shows including Moral Orel, Titan Maximum, Robot Chicken: Star Wars, Frisky Dingo, Tim and Eric Awesome Show Great Job and Childrens Hospital (airing uncensored with profanity intact), along with the latest additions but aired at a different time, Metalocalypse and The Venture Bros, the latter making it the third show with Aqua Teen Hunger Force and Harvey Birdman to have been aired on both the old and the new block.Some series that aired on Adult Swim have been released to Region 4 DVD by Madman Entertainment, including shows that have never been shown on Australian television before. Madman Entertainment has also released R4 exclusive DVDs not available in the United States, including Volume 2 and 3 of Moral Orel and complete collections of Minoriteam and Assy McGee.\\nThe Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters has also been quietly released to DVD. After moving to The Comedy Channel, Adult Swim does not currently air in New Zealand.In June 2016, Channel 9 signed a two-year deal with Turner Broadcasting to stream a small block of Adult Swim on 9Go! Robot Chicken and Aqua Teen Hunger Force usually broadcast in this block.\\n\\n\\n=== Canada ===\\n\\nTeletoon's English-language service in Canada has an adult-oriented block called \\\"Teletoon at Night\\\" (previously known as \\\"The Detour\\\") that airs programming similar to Adult Swim every night. Adult Swim programs that have aired in the past include Moral Orel, Aqua Teen Hunger Force, Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law, Metalocalypse, Robot Chicken, Squidbillies,  12 oz. Mouse, Stroker and Hoop, Loiter Squad, Eagleheart, The Boondocks, The Venture Bros., Home Movies, Tom Goes to the Mayor and Space Ghost Coast to Coast.\\nTim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job! aired on Bell Media's The Comedy Network. Since July 2007, 7 of the 14 Adult Swim programs airing on The Detour left the block and made way for Canadian-made adult cartoon series. Robot Chicken was the final Adult Swim series on the block. Teletoon's French-language service also has an adult-oriented block called \\\"Teletoon la Nuit\\\" that airs shows like Futurama, Family Guy, Home Movies, Robot Chicken, American Dad! and The Boondocks.\\nMeanwhile, YTV aired anime series that premiered on Adult Swim in its Bionix block. As well, G4's Anime Current block, Razer's (now MTV2) Kamikaze block, the defunct Scream (later Dusk) and Super Channel have all aired various anime titles.\\nIn June 2009, G4 Canada Canada launched Adult Digital Distraction, a programing block featuring many Adult Swim shows. In late 2011, the block was discontinued due to pressure from the CRTC on account of the channel deviating from its original format (which was to air technology-related programming). The block had briefly been relaunched featuring Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!, Eagleheart, NTSF:SD:SUV::, Delocated, Metalocalypse, Aqua Teen Hunger Force, Superjail!, and The Venture Bros. but was once again discontinued in 2012.\\nOn February 2, 2012, TELETOON Canada Inc. announced that it would be launching a Canadian version of Adult Swim, sharing channel space with the Canadian version of Cartoon Network as one speciality channel. The block launched on July 4, 2012. From September 2015 - September 2017, all of Adult Swim's original series were aired exclusively on the block.\\nIn December 2013, Much began airing Childrens Hospital and, later, its spinoff, Newsreaders. They also aired the short-lived series The Jack and Triumph Show.\\nIn October 2014, Netflix began streaming Mike Tyson Mysteries the day after its U.S. television premiere.\\nOn February 25, 2016, Williams Street launched a Canada-specific subscription video-on-demand service for iOS and Android devices. The app contains the majority of Adult Swim produced content, including programming not seen on Canadian television. New premieres are added soon after their U.S. broadcast, with the exception of new episodes of Robot Chicken and, initially, Rick and Morty, which are added the day after its premiere on the Canadian block.\\n\\n\\n=== France ===\\nThe block was launched on March 4, 2011, and airs every night from 11 pm to 6 am on Cartoon Network France. It has aired Aqua Teen Hunger Force, Harvey Birdman: Attorney at Law, Metalocalypse, Moral Orel, Robot Chicken and Squidbillies. Like most international Adult Swim blocks, it does not air Fox and action shows. Most of the block's programming is not dubbed and airs with English audio and French subtitles.\\nIn the early 2000s, there was a late-night block called \\\"Dezaxe\\\", which carried the 2001 Adult Swim look, but did not have any adult shows, except for Home Movies. Case Closed was aired on Cartoon Network and Toonami. Dezaxe aired random Cartoon Network shows and old promos.\\nA new block of Adult Swim is launched to March 2015 in L'Enorme TV.

Rick and Morty also airs on the same channel.\\n\\n\\n=== Latin America ===\\nIn Latin America, an Adult Swim block aired during the overnight hours on Cartoon Network beginning on October 7, 2005. It was originally carried on the regional version of the channel, when it was pulled off and picked up by I.Sat, another Turner Broadcasting System Latin America-owned-and-operated network, due to the fact that it was received with negative reviews from parents.On October 29, 2010, I.Sat revealed that it was cutting Adult Swim programming due to low ratings, adding: \\\"No matter if we add new shows, it would not work\\\". Adult Swim once had a SAP audio in early 2007.\\nIn 2014, it was announced that Adult Swim would return to Latin America that same year. Adult Swim premiered on the Brazilian feed of TBS on November 3, 2014. Adult Swim relaunched in Latin America on April 3, 2015, on I.Sat, in English with Spanish subtitles, premiering Rick and Morty and many other shows for the first time on the region.In January 2018, the block begins to be broadcast throughout Latin America on TBS, after having been released four years ago only on its Brazilian feed and unlike I.Sat, this block is broadcast in Spanish.\\n\\n\\n=== Poland ===\\nAlthough the Adult Swim channel does not exist on any of Poland's channels, AXN Spin (which is an offshoot of AXN Poland) airs Robot Chicken and The Boondocks.\\n\\n\\n=== Russia ===\\n2x2, a Russian channel specializing in animation, airs Adult Swim's original series.

In 1821, San Diego became part of the newly independent Mexico, which reformed as the First Mexican Republic two years later. California became part of the United States in 1848 following the Mexican-American War and was admitted to the union as a state in 1850.\\nThe city is the seat of San Diego County and is the economic center of the region as well as the San Diego-Tijuana metropolitan area. San Diego's main economic engines are military and defense-related activities, tourism, international trade, and manufacturing. The presence of the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), with the affiliated UCSD Medical Center, has helped make the area a center of research in biotechnology.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\n\\n=== Pre-colonial period ===\\n\\nThe original inhabitants of the region are now known as the San Dieguito and La Jolla people. The area of San Diego has been inhabited by the Kumeyaay people.\\n\\n\\n=== Spanish period ===\\n\\nThe first European to visit the region was explorer Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo, sailing under the flag of Castile but possibly born in Portugal. Sailing his flagship San Salvador from Navidad, New Spain, Cabrillo claimed the bay for the Spanish Empire in 1542, and named the site \\\"San Miguel\\\". In November 1602, Sebastian Vizcaino was sent to map the California coast. Arriving on his flagship San Diego, Vizcaino surveyed the harbor and what are now Mission Bay and Point Loma and named the area for the Catholic Saint Didacus, a Spaniard more commonly known as San Diego de Alcala. On November 12, 1602, the first Christian religious service of record in Alta California was conducted by Friar Antonio de la Ascension, a member of Vizcaino's expedition, to celebrate the feast day of San Diego.\\n\\nPermanent colonization of California and of San Diego began in 1769 with the arrival of four contingents of Spaniards from New Spain and the Baja California peninsula. Two seaborne parties reached San Diego Bay: the San Carlos, under Vicente Vila and including as notable members the engineer and cartographer Miguel Costanso and the soldier and future governor Pedro Fages, and the San Antonio, under Juan Perez. An initial overland expedition to San Diego from the south was led by the soldier Fernando Rivera and included the Franciscan missionary, explorer, and chronicler Juan Crespi, followed by a second party led by the designated governor Gaspar de Portola and including the mission president (and now saint) Junipero Serra.In May 1769, Portola established the Fort Presidio of San Diego on a hill near the San Diego River. It was the first settlement by Europeans in what is now the state of California. In July of the same year, Mission San Diego de Alcala was founded by Franciscan friars under Serra. By 1797, the mission boasted the largest native population in Alta California, with over 1,400 neophytes living in and around the mission proper. Mission San Diego was the southern anchor in Alta California of the historic mission trail El Camino Real. Both the Presidio and the Mission are National Historic Landmarks.\\n\\n\\n=== Mexican period ===\\nIn 1821, Mexico won its independence from Spain, and San Diego became part of the Mexican territory of Alta California. In 1822, Mexico began attempting to extend its authority over the coastal territory of Alta California. The fort on Presidio Hill was gradually abandoned, while the town of San Diego grew up on the level land below Presidio Hill. The Mission was secularized by the Mexican government in 1834, and most of the Mission lands were granted to former soldiers. The 432 residents of the town petitioned the governor to form a pueblo, and Juan Maria Osuna was elected the first alcalde (\\\"municipal magistrate\\\"), defeating Pio Pico in the vote. (See, List of pre-statehood mayors of San Diego.) However, San Diego had been losing population throughout the 1830s and in 1838 the town lost its pueblo status because its size dropped to an estimated 100 to 150 residents. Beyond town Mexican land grants expanded the number of California ranchos that modestly added to the local economy.\\nAmericans gained increased awareness of California, and its commercial possibilities, from the writings of two countrymen involved in the often officially forbidden, to foreigners, but economically significant hide and tallow trade, where San Diego was a major port and the only one with an adequate harbor: William Shaler's \\\"Journal of a Voyage Between China and the North-Western Coast of America, Made in 1804\\\" and Richard Henry Dana's more substantial and convincing account, of his 1834-36 voyage, the classic Two Years Before the Mast.In 1846, the United States went to war against Mexico and sent a naval and land expedition to conquer Alta California. At first they had an easy time of it capturing the major ports including San Diego, but the Californios in southern Alta California struck back. Following the successful revolt in Los Angeles, the American garrison at San Diego was driven out without firing a shot in early October 1846. Mexican partisans held San Diego for three weeks until October 24, 1846, when the Americans recaptured it. For the next several months the Americans were blockaded inside the pueblo. Skirmishes occurred daily and snipers shot into the town every night. The Californios drove cattle away from the pueblo hoping to starve the Americans and their Californio supporters out. On December 1 the Americans garrison learned that the dragoons of General Stephen W. Kearney were at Warner's Ranch. Commodore Robert F. Stockton sent a mounted force of fifty under Captain Archibald Gillespie to march north to meet him. Their joint command of 150 men, returning to San Diego, encountered about 93 Californios under Andres Pico. In the ensuing Battle of San Pasqual, fought in the San Pasqual Valley which is now part of the city of San Diego, the Americans suffered their worst losses in the campaign. Subsequently, a column led by Lieutenant Gray arrived from San Diego, rescuing Kearny's battered and blockaded command.Stockton and Kearny went on to recover Los Angeles and force the capitulation of Alta California with the \\\"Treaty of Cahuenga\\\" on January 13, 1847. As a result of the Mexican-American War of 1846-48, the territory of Alta California, including San Diego, was ceded to the United States by Mexico, under the terms of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848. The Mexican negotiators of that treaty tried to retain San Diego as part of Mexico, but the Americans insisted that San Diego was \\\"for every commercial purpose of nearly equal importance to us with that of San Francisco,\\\" and the Mexican-American border was eventually established to be one league south of the southernmost point of San Diego Bay, so as to include the entire bay within the United States.\\n\\n\\n=== American period ===\\n\\nThe state of California was admitted to the United States in 1850. That same year San Diego was designated the seat of the newly established San Diego County and was incorporated as a city. Joshua H. Bean, the last alcalde of San Diego, was elected the first mayor. Two years later the city was bankrupt; the California legislature revoked the city's charter and placed it under control of a board of trustees, where it remained until 1889. A city charter was reestablished in 1889, and today's city charter was adopted in 1931.The original town of San Diego was located at the foot of Presidio Hill, in the area which is now Old Town San Diego State Historic Park. The location was not ideal, being several miles away from navigable water at its port at La Playa. In 1850, William Heath Davis promoted a new development by the bay shore called \\\"New San Diego\\\", several miles south of the original settlement; however, for several decades the new development consisted only of a pier, a few houses and an Army depot for the support of Fort Yuma.  After 1854, the fort became supplied by sea and by steamboats on the Colorado River and the depot fell into disuse.  From 1857 to 1860, San Diego became the western terminus of the San Antonio-San Diego Mail Line, the earliest overland stagecoach and mail operation from the Eastern United States to California, coming from Texas through New Mexico Territory in less than 30 days.In the late 1860s, Alonzo Horton promoted a move to the bayside area, which he called \\\"New Town\\\" and which became Downtown San Diego. Horton promoted the area heavily, and people and businesses began to relocate to New Town because its location on San Diego Bay was convenient to shipping.  New Town soon eclipsed the original settlement, known to this day as Old Town, and became the economic and governmental heart of the city. Still, San Diego remained a relative backwater town until the arrival of a railroad connection in 1878.\\n\\nIn the early part of the 20th century, San Diego hosted two World's Fairs: the Panama-California Exposition in 1915-16 and the California Pacific International Exposition in 1935-36. Both expositions were held in Balboa Park, and many of the Spanish/Baroque-style buildings that were built for those expositions remain to this day as central features of the park. The buildings were intended to be temporary structures, but most remained in continuous use until they progressively fell into disrepair. Most were eventually rebuilt, using castings of the original facades to retain the architectural style. The menagerie of exotic animals featured at the 1915 exposition provided the basis for the San Diego Zoo. During the 1950s there was a citywide festival called Fiesta del Pacifico highlighting the area's Spanish and Mexican past. In the 2010s there was a proposal for a large-scale celebration of the 100th anniversary of Balboa Park, but the plans were abandoned when the organization tasked with putting on the celebration went out of business.The southern portion of the Point Loma peninsula was set aside for military purposes as early as 1852. Over the next several decades the Army set up a series of coastal artillery batteries and named the area Fort Rosecrans. Significant U.S. Navy presence began in 1901 with the establishment of the Navy Coaling Station in Point Loma, and expanded greatly during the 1920s. By 1930, the city was host to Naval Base San Diego, Naval Training Center San Diego, San Diego Naval Hospital, Camp Matthews, and Camp Kearny (now Marine Corps Air Station Miramar). The city was also an early center for aviation: as early as World War I, San Diego was proclaiming itself \\\"The Air Capital of the West\\\". The city was home to important airplane developers and manufacturers like Ryan Airlines (later Ryan Aeronautical), founded in 1925, and Consolidated Aircraft (later Convair), founded in 1923. Charles A. Lindbergh's plane The Spirit of St. Louis was built in San Diego in 1927 by Ryan Airlines.During World War II, San Diego became a major hub of military and defense activity, due to the presence of so many military installations and defense manufacturers. The city's population grew rapidly during and after World War II, more than doubling between 1930 (147,995) and 1950 (333,865). During the final months of the war, the Japanese had a plan to target multiple U.S. cities for biological attack, starting with San Diego. The plan was called \\\"Operation Cherry Blossoms at Night\\\" and called for kamikaze planes filled with fleas infected with plague (Yersinia pestis) to crash into civilian population centers in the city, hoping to spread plague in the city and effectively kill tens of thousands of civilians. The plan was scheduled to launch on September 22, 1945, but was not carried out because Japan surrendered five weeks earlier.After World War II, the military continued to play a major role in the local economy, but post-Cold War cutbacks took a heavy toll on the local defense and aerospace industries. The resulting downturn led San Diego leaders to seek to diversify the city's economy by focusing on research and science, as well as tourism.From the start of the 20th century through the 1970s, the American tuna fishing fleet and tuna canning industry were based in San Diego, \\\"the tuna capital of the world\\\". San Diego's first tuna cannery was founded in 1911, and by the mid-1930s the canneries employed more than 1,000 people. A large fishing fleet supported the canneries, mostly staffed by immigrant fishermen from Japan, and later from the Portuguese Azores and Italy whose influence is still felt in neighborhoods like Little Italy and Point Loma. Due to rising costs and foreign competition, the last of the canneries closed in the early 1980s.Downtown San Diego was in decline in the 1960s and 1970s, but experienced some urban renewal since the early 1980s, including the opening of Horton Plaza, the revival of the Gaslamp Quarter, and the construction of the San Diego Convention Center; Petco Park opened in 2004.\\n\\n\\n== Geography ==\\n\\nAccording to SDSU professor emeritus Monte Marshall, San Diego Bay is \\\"the surface expression of a north-south-trending, nested graben\\\". The Rose Canyon and Point Loma fault zones are part of the San Andreas Fault system. About 40 miles (64 km) east of the bay are the Laguna Mountains in the Peninsular Ranges, which are part of the backbone of the American continents.The city lies on approximately 200 deep canyons and hills separating its mesas, creating small pockets of natural open space scattered throughout the city and giving it a hilly geography. Traditionally, San Diegans have built their homes and businesses on the mesas, while leaving the urban canyons relatively wild. Thus, the canyons give parts of the city a segmented feel, creating gaps between otherwise proximate neighborhoods and contributing to a low-density, car-centered environment. The San Diego River runs through the middle of San Diego from east to west, creating a river valley which serves to divide the city into northern and southern segments. During the historic period and presumably earlier as well, the river has shifted its flow back and forth between San Diego Bay and Mission Bay, and its fresh water was the focus of the earliest Spanish explorers. Miguel Costanso, a cartographer, wrote in 1769, \\\"When asked by signs where the watering-place was, the Indians pointed to a grove which could be seen at a considerable distance to the northeast, giving to understand that a river or creek flowed through it, and that they would lead our men to it if they would follow.\\\" That river was the San Diego River. Several reservoirs and Mission Trails Regional Park also lie between and separate developed areas of the city.\\n\\nNotable peaks within the city limits include Cowles Mountain, the highest point in the city at 1,591 feet (485 m); Black Mountain at 1,558 feet (475 m); and Mount Soledad at 824 feet (251 m). The Cuyamaca Mountains and Laguna Mountains rise to the east of the city, and beyond the mountains are desert areas. The Cleveland National Forest is a half-hour drive from downtown San Diego. Numerous farms are found in the valleys northeast and southeast of the city.\\nIn its 2013 ParkScore ranking, The Trust for Public Land  reported that San Diego had the 9th-best park system among the 50 most populous U.S. cities.ParkScore ranks city park systems by a formula that analyzes acreage, access, and service and investment.\\n\\n\\n=== Communities and neighborhoods ===\\n\\nThe City of San Diego recognizes 52 individual areas as Community Planning Areas. Within a given planning area there may be several distinct neighborhoods. Altogether the city contains more than 100 identified neighborhoods.\\nDowntown San Diego is located on San Diego Bay. Balboa Park encompasses several mesas and canyons to the northeast, surrounded by older, dense urban communities including Hillcrest and North Park. To the east and southeast lie City Heights, the College Area, and Southeast San Diego. To the north lies Mission Valley and Interstate 8. The communities north of the valley and freeway, and south of Marine Corps Air Station Miramar, include Clairemont, Kearny Mesa, Tierrasanta, and Navajo. Stretching north from Miramar are the northern suburbs of Mira Mesa, Scripps Ranch, Rancho Penasquitos, and Rancho Bernardo. The far northeast portion of the city encompasses Lake Hodges and the San Pasqual Valley, which holds an agricultural preserve. Carmel Valley and Del Mar Heights occupy the northwest corner of the city. To their south are Torrey Pines State Reserve and the business center of the Golden Triangle. Further south are the beach and coastal communities of La Jolla, Pacific Beach, Mission Beach, and Ocean Beach. Point Loma occupies the peninsula across San Diego Bay from downtown. The communities of South San Diego, such as San Ysidro and Otay Mesa, are located next to the Mexico-United States border, and are physically separated from the rest of the city by the cities of National City and Chula Vista. A narrow strip of land at the bottom of San Diego Bay connects these southern neighborhoods with the rest of the city.\\nFor the most part, San Diego neighborhood boundaries tend to be understood by its residents based on geographical boundaries like canyons and street patterns. The city recognized the importance of its neighborhoods when it organized its 2008 General Plan around the concept of a \\\"City of Villages\\\".\\n\\n\\n=== Cityscape ===\\n\\nSan Diego was originally centered on the Old Town district, but by the late 1860s the focus had shifted to the bayfront, in the belief that this new location would increase trade. As the \\\"New Town\\\" - present-day Downtown - waterfront location quickly developed, it eclipsed Old Town as the center of San Diego.The development of skyscrapers over 300 feet (91 m) in San Diego is attributed to the construction of the El Cortez Hotel in 1927, the tallest building in the city from 1927 to 1963. As time went on, multiple buildings claimed the title of San Diego's tallest skyscraper, including the Union Bank of California Building and Symphony Towers. Currently the tallest building in San Diego is One America Plaza, standing 500 feet (150 m) tall, which was completed in 1991. The downtown skyline contains no super-talls, as a regulation put in place by the Federal Aviation Administration in the 1970s set a 500 feet (152 m) limit on the height of buildings within a one-mile (1.6 km) radius of the San Diego International Airport. An iconic description of the skyline includes its skyscrapers being compared to the tools of a toolbox.\\n\\n\\n=== Climate ===\\n\\nSan Diego has one of the top-ten best climates according to the Farmers' Almanac and has one of the two best summer climates in America as scored by The Weather Channel. Under the Koppen-Geiger climate classification system, the San Diego area has been variously categorized as having either a semi-arid climate (BSh in the original classification and BSn in modified Koppen classification) or a Mediterranean climate (Csa and Csb). San Diego's climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and mild winters, with most of the annual precipitation falling between December and March. The city has a mild climate year-round, with an average of 201 days above 70 degF (21 degC) and low rainfall (9-13 inches [230-330 mm] annually).\\nThe climate in San Diego, like most of Southern California, often varies significantly over short geographical distances, resulting in microclimates. In San Diego, this is mostly because of the city's topography (the Bay, and the numerous hills, mountains, and canyons). Frequently, particularly during the \\\"May gray/June gloom\\\" period, a thick \\\"marine layer\\\" cloud cover keeps the air cool and damp within a few miles of the coast, but yields to bright cloudless sunshine approximately 5-10 miles (8.0-16.1 km) inland. Sometimes the June gloom lasts into July, causing cloudy skies over most of San Diego for the entire day. Even in the absence of June gloom, inland areas experience much more significant temperature variations than coastal areas, where the ocean serves as a moderating influence. Thus, for example, downtown San Diego averages January lows of 50 degF (10 degC) and August highs of 78 degF (26 degC). The city of El Cajon just 10 miles (16 km) inland from downtown San Diego, averages January lows of 42 degF (6 degC) and August highs of 88 degF (31 degC).\\nA sign of global warming, the average surface temperature of the water at Scripps Pier in the California Current has increased by almost 3 degrees since 1950, according to scientists at Scripps Institution of Oceanography.\\n\\nAnnual rainfall along the coast averages 10.65 inches (271 mm) and the median is 9.6 inches (240 mm). The months of December through March supply most of the rain, with February the only month averaging 2 inches (51 mm) or more. The months of May through September tend to be almost completely dry. Although there are few wet days per month during the rainy period, rainfall can be heavy when it does fall. Rainfall is usually greater in the higher elevations of San Diego; some of the higher areas can receive 11-15 inches (280-380 mm) per year. Variability from year to year can be dramatic: in the wettest years of 1883/1884 and 1940/1941 more than 24 inches (610 mm) fell, whilst in the driest years there was as little as 3.2 inches (80 mm). The wettest month on record is December 1921 with 9.21 inches (234 mm).\\nSnow in the city is so rare that it has been observed only five times in the century-and-a-half that records have been kept. In 1949 and 1967, snow stayed on the ground for a few hours in higher locations like Point Loma and La Jolla. The other three occasions, in 1882, 1946, and 1987, involved flurries but no accumulation.\\n\\n\\n=== Ecology ===\\n\\nLike much of southern California, the majority of San Diego's current area was originally occupied on the west by coastal sage scrub and on the east by chaparral, plant communities made up mostly of drought-resistant shrubs. The steep and varied topography and proximity to the ocean create a number of different habitats within the city limits, including tidal marsh and canyons. The chaparral and coastal sage scrub habitats in low elevations along the coast are prone to wildfire, and the rates of fire increased in the 20th century, due primarily to fires starting near the borders of urban and wild areas.\\nSan Diego's broad city limits encompass a number of large nature preserves, including Torrey Pines State Reserve, Los Penasquitos Canyon Preserve, and Mission Trails Regional Park. Torrey Pines State Reserve and a coastal strip continuing to the north constitute one of only two locations where the rare species of Torrey Pine, Pinus torreyana, is found.  Due to the steep topography that prevents or discourages building, along with some efforts for preservation, there are also a large number of canyons within the city limits that serve as nature preserves, including Switzer Canyon, Tecolote Canyon Natural Park, and Marian Bear Memorial Park in San Clemente Canyon, as well as a number of small parks and preserves.\\nSan Diego County has one of the highest counts of animal and plant species that appear on the endangered list of counties in the United States. Because of its diversity of habitat and its position on the Pacific Flyway, San Diego County has recorded 492 different bird species, more than any other region in the country. San Diego always scores high in the number of bird species observed in the annual Christmas Bird Count, sponsored by the Audubon Society, and it is known as one of the \\\"birdiest\\\" areas in the United States.San Diego and its backcountry suffer from periodic wildfires. In October 2003, San Diego was the site of the Cedar Fire, at that time the largest wildfire in California over the past century. The fire burned 280,000 acres (1,100 km2), killed 15 people, and destroyed more than 2,200 homes. In addition to damage caused by the fire, smoke resulted in a significant increase in emergency room visits due to asthma, respiratory problems, eye irritation, and smoke inhalation; the poor air quality caused San Diego County schools to close for a week. Wildfires four years later destroyed some areas, particularly within Rancho Bernardo, as well as the nearby communities of Rancho Santa Fe and Ramona.\\n\\n\\n== Demographics ==\\n\\nThe city had a population of 1,307,402 according to the 2010 census, distributed over a land area of 372.1 square miles (963.7 km2). The urban area of San Diego extends beyond the administrative city limits and had a total population of 2,956,746, making it the third-largest urban area in the state, after that of the Los Angeles metropolitan area and San Francisco metropolitan area. They, along with the Riverside-San Bernardino, form those metropolitan areas in California larger than the San Diego metropolitan area, which had a total population of 3,095,313 at the 2010 census.\\nThe 2010 population represents an increase of just under 7% from the 1,223,400 people, 450,691 households, and 271,315 families reported in 2000. The estimated city population in 2009 was 1,306,300. The population density was 3,771.9 inhabitants per square mile (1,456.3/km2). The racial makeup of San Diego was 58.9% White, 6.7% African American, 0.6% Native American, 15.9% Asian (5.9% Filipino, 2.7% Chinese, 2.5% Vietnamese, 1.3% Indian, 1.0% Korean, 0.7% Japanese, 0.4% Laotian, 0.3% Cambodian, 0.1% Thai). 0.5% Pacific Islander (0.2% Guamanian, 0.1% Samoan, 0.1% Native Hawaiian), 12.3% from other races, and 5.1% from two or more races. The ethnic makeup of the city was 28.8% Hispanic or Latino (of any race); 24.9% of the total population were Mexican American, and 0.6% were Puerto Rican. Median age of Hispanics was 27.5 years, compared to 35.1 years overall and 41.6 years among non-Hispanic whites; Hispanics were the largest group in all ages under 18, and non-Hispanic whites constituted 63.1% of population 55 and older.\\n\\nAs of  December 2012, San Diego has the third-largest homeless population in the United States; the city's homeless population has the largest percentage of homeless veterans in the nation. The population of homeless veterans in San Diego has been reduced to 1,150 people in 2016, from 2,100 in 2009.In 2000 there were 451,126 households, out of which 30.2% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 44.6% were married couples living together, 11.4% had a female householder with no husband present, and 39.8% were non-families. Households made up of individuals account for 28.0%, and 7.4% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.61, and the average family size was 3.30.\\nThe U.S. Census Bureau reported that in 2000, 24.0% of San Diego residents were under 18, and 10.5% were 65 and over. As of  2011 the median age was 35.6; more than a quarter of residents were under age 20 and 11% were over age 65. Millennials (ages 18 through 34) constitute 27.1% of San Diego's population, the second-highest percentage in a major U.S. city. The San Diego County regional planning agency, SANDAG, provides tables and graphs breaking down the city population into five-year age groups.In 2000, the median income for a household in the city was $45,733, and the median income for a family was $53,060. Males had a median income of $36,984 versus $31,076 for females. The per capita income for the city was $35,199. According to Forbes in 2005, San Diego was the fifth wealthiest U.S. city but about 10.6% of families and 14.6% of the population were below the poverty line, including 20.0% of those under age 18 and 7.6% of those age 65 or over. San Diego was rated the fifth-best place to live in the United States in 2006 by Money magazine, although it was no longer rated in the top 100 places by 2017. As of January 1, 2008 estimates by the San Diego Association of Governments revealed that the household median income for San Diego rose to $66,715, up from $45,733 in 2000.San Diego was named the ninth-most LGBT-friendly city in the U.S. in 2013. The city also has the seventh-highest percentage of gay residents in the U.S. Additionally in 2013, San Diego State University (SDSU), one of the city's prominent universities, was named one of the top LGBT-friendly campuses in the nation.According to a 2014 study by the Pew Research Center, 68% of the population of the city identified themselves as Christians, with 22% professing attendance at a variety of churches that could be considered Protestant, and 32% professing Roman Catholic beliefs. while 27% claim no religious affiliation. The same study says that other religions (including Judaism, Buddhism, Islam, and Hinduism) collectively make up about 5% of the population.\\n\\n\\n== Economy ==\\n\\nThe largest sectors of San Diego's economy are defense/military, tourism, international trade, and research/manufacturing. In 2014, San Diego was designated by a Forbes columnist as the best city in the country to launch a small business or startup company.\\n\\n\\n=== Defense and military ===\\n\\nThe economy of San Diego is influenced by its deepwater port, which includes the only major submarine and shipbuilding yards on the West Coast. Several major national defense contractors were started and are headquartered in San Diego, including General Atomics, Cubic, and NASSCO.San Diego hosts the largest naval fleet in the world: In 2008 it was home to 53 ships, over 120 tenant commands, and more than 35,000 sailors, soldiers, Department of Defense civilian employees and contractors. About 5 percent of all civilian jobs in the county are military-related, and 15,000 businesses in San Diego County rely on Department of Defense contracts.Military bases in San Diego include US Navy facilities, Marine Corps bases, and Coast Guard stations.\\nThe city is \\\"home to the majority of the U.S. Pacific Fleet's surface combatants, all of the Navy's West Coast amphibious ships and a variety of Coast Guard and Military Sealift Command vessels\\\".\\n\\n\\n=== Tourism ===\\n\\nTourism is a major industry owing to the city's climate, beaches, and tourist attractions such as Balboa Park, Belmont amusement park, San Diego Zoo, San Diego Zoo Safari Park, and SeaWorld San Diego. San Diego's Spanish and Mexican heritage is reflected in many historic sites across the city, such as Mission San Diego de Alcala and Old Town San Diego State Historic Park.  Also, the local craft brewing industry attracts an increasing number of visitors for \\\"beer tours\\\" and the annual San Diego Beer Week in November; San Diego has been called \\\"America's Craft Beer Capital.\\\"San Diego County hosted more than 32 million visitors in 2012; collectively they spent an estimated $8 billion. The visitor industry provides employment for more than 160,000 people.San Diego's cruise ship industry used to be the second-largest in California. Numerous cruise lines operate out of San Diego. However, cruise ship business has been in decline since 2008, when the Port hosted over 250 ship calls and more than 900,000 passengers. By 2016-2017 the number of ship calls had fallen to 90.Local sight-seeing cruises are offered in San Diego Bay and Mission Bay, as well as whale-watching cruises to observe the migration of gray whales, peaking in mid-January. Sport fishing is another popular tourist attraction; San Diego is home to southern California's biggest sport fishing fleet.\\n\\n\\n=== International trade ===\\nSan Diego's commercial port and its location on the United States-Mexico border make international trade an important factor in the city's economy. The city is authorized by the United States government to operate as a Foreign Trade Zone.The city shares a 15-mile (24 km) border with Mexico that includes two border crossings. San Diego hosts the busiest international border crossing in the world, in the San Ysidro neighborhood at the San Ysidro Port of Entry. A second, primarily commercial border crossing operates in the Otay Mesa area; it is the largest commercial crossing on the California-Baja California border and handles the third-highest volume of trucks and dollar value of trade among all United States-Mexico land crossings.One of the Port of San Diego's two cargo facilities is located in Downtown San Diego at the Tenth Avenue Marine Terminal.

In 2006, its government changed from a council-manager government to a strong mayor government, as decided by a citywide vote in 2004. The mayor is in effect the chief executive officer of the city, while the council is the legislative body. The City of San Diego is responsible for police, public safety, streets, water and sewer service, planning and zoning, and similar services within its borders.

After a series of appeals, the 12 perjury counts were dismissed in 1990 based on claims of juror misconduct; the remaining conspiracy count was reduced to a misdemeanor and then dismissed.A 2002 scheme to underfund pensions for city employees led to the San Diego pension scandal. This resulted in the resignation of newly re-elected Mayor Dick Murphy and the criminal indictment of six pension board members. Those charges were finally dismissed by a federal judge in 2010.On November 28, 2005, U.S. Congressman Randy \\\"Duke\\\" Cunningham resigned after being convicted on federal bribery charges. He had represented California's 50th congressional district, which includes much of the northern portion of the city of San Diego. In 2006, Cunningham was sentenced to a 100-month prison sentence. He was released in 2013.\\nIn 2005 two city council members, Ralph Inzunza and Deputy Mayor Michael Zucchet - who briefly took over as acting mayor when Murphy resigned - were convicted of extortion, wire fraud, and conspiracy to commit wire fraud for taking campaign contributions from a strip club owner and his associates, allegedly in exchange for trying to repeal the city's \\\"no touch\\\" laws at strip clubs. Both subsequently resigned. Inzunza was sentenced to 21 months in prison. In 2009, a judge acquitted Zucchet on seven out of the nine counts against him, and granted his petition for a new trial on the other two charges; the remaining charges were eventually dropped.In July 2013, three former supporters of mayor Bob Filner asked him to resign because of allegations of repeated sexual harassment. Over the ensuing six weeks, 18 women came forward to publicly claim that Filner had sexually harassed them, and multiple individuals and groups called for him to resign. Filner agreed to resign effective August 30, 2013, subsequently pleaded guilty to one felony count of false imprisonment and two misdemeanor battery charges, and was sentenced to house arrest and probation.\\n\\n\\n=== Crime ===\\n\\nSan Diego was ranked as the 20th-safest city in America in 2013 by Business Insider. According to Forbes magazine, San Diego was the ninth-safest city in the top 10 list of safest cities in the U.S. in 2010. Like most major cities, San Diego had a declining crime rate from 1990 to 2000. Crime in San Diego increased in the early 2000s. In 2004, San Diego had the sixth lowest crime rate of any U.S. city with over half a million residents. From 2002 to 2006, the crime rate overall dropped 0.8%, though not evenly by category. While violent crime decreased 12.4% during this period, property crime increased 1.1%. Total property crimes per 100,000 people were lower than the national average in 2008.According to Uniform Crime Report statistics compiled by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in 2010, there were 5,616 violent crimes and 30,753 property crimes.

There are three ABA accredited law schools in the city, which include California Western School of Law, Thomas Jefferson School of Law, and University of San Diego School of Law. There is also one law school, Western Sierra Law School, not accredited by the ABA.\\n\\n\\n=== Libraries ===\\n\\nThe city-run San Diego Public Library system is headquartered downtown and has 36 branches throughout the city.  The newest location is in Skyline Hills, which broke ground in 2015. The libraries have had reduced operating hours since 2003 due to the city's financial problems. In 2006 the city increased spending on libraries by $2.1 million. A new nine-story Central Library on Park Boulevard at J Street opened on September 30, 2013.In addition to the municipal public library system, there are nearly two dozen libraries open to the public run by other governmental agencies, and by schools, colleges, and universities.

Since the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) licensed seven television stations in Los Angeles, two VHF channels were available for San Diego because of its relative proximity to the larger city. In 1952, however, the FCC began licensing UHF channels, making it possible for cities such as San Diego to acquire more stations. Stations based in Mexico (with ITU prefixes of XE and XH) also serve the San Diego market. Television stations today include XHTJB 3 (Once TV), XETV 6 (Canal 5), KFMB 8 (CBS, with CW on DT2), KGTV 10 (ABC), XEWT 12 (Televisa Regional), KPBS 15 (PBS), KBNT-CD 17 (Univision), XHTIT-TDT 21 (Azteca 7), XHJK-TDT 27 (Azteca 13), XHAS 33 (Telemundo), K35DG-D 35 (UCSD-TV), KDTF-LD 51 (Telefutura), KNSD 39 (NBC), KZSD-LP 41 (Azteca America), KSEX-CD 42 (Infomercials), XHBJ-TDT 45 (Gala TV), XHDTV 49 (MNTV), KUSI 51 (Independent), XHUAA-TDT 57  (Canal de las Estrellas), and KSWB-TV 69 (Fox). San Diego has an 80.6 percent cable penetration rate.Due to the ratio of U.S. and Mexican-licensed stations, San Diego is the largest media market in the United States that is legally unable to support a television station duopoly between two full-power stations under FCC regulations, which disallow duopolies in metropolitan areas with fewer than nine full-power television stations and require that there must be eight unique station owners that remain once a duopoly is formed (there are only seven full-power stations on the California side of the San Diego-Tijuana market). Though the E. W. Scripps Company owns KGTV and KZSD-LP, they are not considered a duopoly under the FCC's legal definition as common ownership between full-power and low-power television stations in the same market is permitted regardless to the number of stations licensed to the area. As a whole, the Mexico side of the San Diego-Tijuana market has two duopolies and one triopoly (Entravision Communications owns both XHAS-TV and XHDTV-TV, Azteca owns XHJK-TV and XHTIT-TV, and Grupo Televisa owns XHUAA-TV and XHWT-TV along with being the license holder for XETV-TV, which was formerly managed by California-based subsidiary Bay City Television).\\nSan Diego's television market is limited to only San Diego county. The Imperial Valley has its own market (which also extends into western Arizona), while neighboring Orange and Riverside counties are part of the Los Angeles market. (Sometimes in the past, a missing network affiliate in the Imperial Valley would be available on cable TV from San Diego.)\\nThe radio stations in San Diego include nationwide broadcaster, iHeartMedia; CBS Radio, Midwest Television, Entercom Communications, Finest City Broadcasting, and many other smaller stations and networks. Stations include: KOGO AM 600, KFMB AM 760, KCEO AM 1000, KCBQ AM 1170, K-Praise, KLSD AM 1360 Air America, KFSD 1450 AM, KPBS-FM 89.5, Channel 933, Star 94.1, FM 94/9, FM News and Talk 95.7, Q96 96.1, KyXy 96.5, Free Radio San Diego (AKA Pirate Radio San Diego) 96.9FM FRSD, KWFN 97.3, KXSN 98.1, Jack-FM 100.7, 101.5 KGB-FM, KLVJ 102.1, KSON 103.7, Rock 105.3, and another Pirate Radio station at 106.9FM, as well as a number of local Spanish-language radio stations.\\n\\n\\n== Infrastructure ==\\n\\n\\n=== Utilities ===\\nWater is supplied to residents by the Water Department of the City of San Diego. The city receives most of its water from the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California.\\nGas and electric utilities are provided by San Diego Gas & Electric, a division of Sempra Energy.\\n\\n\\n=== Street lights ===\\nIn the mid-20th century the city had mercury vapor street lamps. In 1978, the city decided to replace them with more efficient sodium vapor lamps. This triggered an outcry from astronomers at Palomar Observatory 60 miles (97 km) north of the city, concerned that the new lamps would increase light pollution and hinder astronomical observation. The city altered its lighting regulations to limit light pollution within 30 miles (48 km) of Palomar.In 2011, the city announced plans to upgrade 80% of its street lighting to new energy-efficient lights that use induction technology, a modified form of fluorescent lamp producing a broader spectrum than sodium vapor lamps. The new system is predicted to save $2.2 million per year in energy and maintenance. The city stated the changes would \\\"make our neighborhoods safer.\\\" They also increase light pollution.In 2014, San Diego announced plans to become the first U.S. city to install cyber-controlled street lighting, using an \\\"intelligent\\\" lighting system to control 3,000 LED street lights.\\n\\n\\n=== Transportation ===\\n\\nWith the automobile being the primary means of transportation for over 80 percent of residents, San Diego is served by a network of freeways and highways. This includes Interstate 5, which runs south to Tijuana and north to Los Angeles; Interstate 8, which runs east to Imperial County and the Arizona Sun Corridor; Interstate 15, which runs northeast through the Inland Empire to Las Vegas and Salt Lake City; and Interstate 805, which splits from I-5 near the Mexican border and rejoins I-5 at Sorrento Valley.\\nMajor state highways include SR 94, which connects downtown with I-805, I-15 and East County; SR 163, which connects downtown with the northeast part of the city, intersects I-805 and merges with I-15 at Miramar; SR 52, which connects La Jolla with East County through Santee and SR 125; SR 56, which connects I-5 with I-15 through Carmel Valley and Rancho Penasquitos; SR 75, which spans San Diego Bay as the San Diego-Coronado Bridge, and also passes through South San Diego as Palm Avenue; and SR 905, which connects I-5 and I-805 to the Otay Mesa Port of Entry.\\nThe stretch of SR 163 that passes through Balboa Park is San Diego's oldest freeway, and has been called one of America's most beautiful parkways.San Diego's roadway system provides an extensive network of cycle routes. Its dry and mild climate makes cycling a convenient year-round option; however, the city's hilly terrain and long average trip distances make cycling less practicable. Older and denser neighborhoods around the downtown tend to be oriented to utility cycling. This is partly because of the grid street patterns now absent in newer developments farther from the urban core, where suburban style arterial roads are much more common. As a result, a majority of cycling is recreational. In 2006, San Diego was rated the best city (with a population over 1 million) for cycling in the U.S.\\n\\nSan Diego is served by the San Diego Trolley light rail system, by the SDMTS bus system, and by Coaster and Amtrak Pacific Surfliner commuter rail; northern San Diego county is also served by the Sprinter light rail line. The trolley primarily serves downtown and surrounding urban communities, Mission Valley, east county, and coastal south bay. A planned mid-coast extension of the Trolley will operate from Old Town to University City and the University of California, San Diego along the I-5 Freeway, with planned operation by 2018. The Amtrak and Coaster trains currently run along the coastline and connect San Diego with Los Angeles, Orange County, Riverside, San Bernardino, and Ventura via Metrolink and the Pacific Surfliner. There are two Amtrak stations in San Diego, in Old Town and the Santa Fe Depot downtown. San Diego transit information about public transportation and commuting is available on the Web and by dialing \\\"511\\\" from any phone in the area.The city has two major commercial airports within or near its city limits. Downtown San Diego International Airport (SAN), also known as Lindbergh Field, is the busiest single-runway airport in the United States. It served over 17 million passengers in 2005, and is dealing with larger numbers every year. It is located on San Diego Bay, three miles (4.8 km) from downtown, and maintains scheduled flights to the rest of the United States (including Hawaii), as well as to Canada, Mexico, Japan, and the United Kingdom. It is operated by an independent agency, the San Diego Regional Airport Authority. Tijuana International Airport has a terminal within the city limits in the Otay Mesa district connected to the rest of the airport in Tijuana, Mexico via the Cross Border Xpress cross-border footbridge. It is the primary airport for flights to the rest of Mexico, and offers connections via Mexico City to the rest of Latin America. In addition, the city has two general-aviation airports, Montgomery Field (MYF) and Brown Field (SDM).\\n \\nRecent regional transportation projects have sought to mitigate congestion, including improvements to local freeways, expansion of San Diego Airport, and doubling the capacity of the cruise ship terminal. Freeway projects included expansion of Interstates 5 and 805 around \\\"The Merge\\\" where these two freeways meet, as well as expansion of Interstate 15 through North County, which includes new high-occupancy-vehicle (HOV) \\\"managed lanes\\\". A tollway (the southern portion of SR 125, known as the South Bay Expressway) connects SR 54 and Otay Mesa, near the Mexican border. According to an assessment in 2007, 37 percent of city streets were in acceptable condition. However, the proposed budget fell $84.6 million short of bringing streets up to an acceptable level. Expansion at the port has included a second cruise terminal on Broadway Pier, opened in 2010. Airport projects include expansion of Terminal Two.\\n\\n\\n== Notable people ==\\n\\n\\n== Sister cities ==\\nSan Diego has 17 sister cities, as designated by Sister Cities International:\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\n1858 San Diego hurricane\\n\\n\\n== Notes ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n=== Bibliography ===\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\n\\nOfficial website \\nCivic San Diego (replaced redevelopment corporations)\\nSANDAG, San Diego's Regional Planning Agency\\nDemographic Fact Sheet from Census Bureau\\nSan Diego Historical Society\\nSan Diego Unified School District\\nSan Diego Public Library\\nSan Diego Tourism Authority (formerly the San Diego Convention and Visitors Bureau)\", \"rev_id\": 856711717, \"accessed\": \"2018-09-03 00:23:59.864295\", \"links\": [\"Japan\", \"California State Assembly\", \"Point Loma\", \"African American\", \"KLSD\", \"San Andreas Fault\", \"Cuyamaca Mountains\", \"Mediterranean climate\", \"Canal de las Estrellas\", \"K35DG-D\", \"American Basketball Association\", \"E.

Together they officially formed the sub-group of Odd Future, MellowHigh in 2011. The song \\\"Rella\\\" from The Odd Future Tape Vol. 2 was originally a MellowHigh song. In April 2012 the group released their first two official songs, \\\"Timbs\\\" produced by Lex Luger and \\\"Go\\\". Along with the song's releases, they announced that they would be working on a collaboration project together.Word on the project would die down, while MellowHype released their second album Numbers, Hodgy Beats released Untitled 2 EP, and Domo Genesis released No Idols with producer The Alchemist. Then on April 20, 2013, the group released a new song and music video, \\\"Troublesome\\\" the first song from their upcoming album. Domo Genesis would state that the entire album was made in two months.On August 24, 2013, it was revealed their self-titled debut album would be released on October 31, 2013. On October 15, 2013, they released the track list, revealing guest appearances from Tyler, The Creator, Earl Sweatshirt, Smoke DZA, Curren$y and Remy Banks.\\n\\n\\n== Release and promotion ==\\nThe group released promotional vlogs leading up to the release, showing footage of them on the Odd Future European tour 2013 and the recording sessions for the album. On September 13, 2013, MellowHigh released \\\"In the Meantime\\\" a leftover track from the album's recording sessions. On October 28, 2013, the album was released for a limited free stream on MySpace.During 2013 the group toured Europe with the rest of Odd Future, including the other sub-group EarlWolf consisting of Earl Sweatshirt and Tyler, The Creator. Following the tour, from October 24 through November 26, 2013 MellowHigh toured North America on a self-titled tour.On September 18, 2013, the group released a snippet of the first single \\\"Yu\\\". On October 10, 2013, the self-directed music video for \\\"Yu\\\" was released, along with the album being released for pre-order on iTunes. \\\"Yu\\\" was met with positive reviews from music critics. The following day the audio to \\\"Extinguisher\\\" was premiered via SoundCloud. On October 28, 2013, the music video was released for \\\"Extinguisher\\\", which included cameo appearances by Tyler, The Creator and Taco Bennett.\\n\\n\\n== Commercial performance ==\\nMellowHigh debuted at number 89 on the US Billboard 200, with first week sales of 4,000 copies in the United States.\\n\\n\\n== Critical reception ==\\nMellowHigh was met with generally positive reviews from music critics. Lizzie Plaugic of CMJ stated, \\\"The trio proves it has a fat bag of tricks: floaty fast rhymes (Get'n Drunk), high gravity boom bap (Troublesome) and haunting alien lullabies (Nobody).\\\" Kyle Kramer of Pitchfork Media said, \\\"These beats are huge, intimidating walls of sound. It may be that surprising people is a young man's game, and it's time for Domo Genesis and Hodgy Beats to settle into their comfortable roles as confident, reliable spitters. But for an album that sounds as off-the-wall as MellowHigh, it feels like a bit of a cop out to be content with insubstantial rapping.\\\" Laurence Day of The Line of Best Fit said, \\\"The overall result is something that painfully needed some outside influences, perhaps another producer to steer them in a worthwhile direction - it's an aimless, winding record that occasionally stumbles upon greatness.\\\"Brian Josephs of XXL gave the album a \\\"L\\\" rating saying, \\\"MellowHigh has its thrills with some credit going to Earl's playful verse on \\\"Cold World,\\\" but too often the album feels stagnant.\\\" Jesse Fairfax of HipHopDX gave the album three out of five stars, saying \\\"As a byproduct of a team that has actualized potential for groundbreaking contributions, MellowHigh misses the mark by a wide margin.\\\" Stephen Kearse of Respect. gave the album a positive review saying, \\\"In the end, what MellowHigh was going for - a solid demonstration of their ability to make interesting music - was definitely accomplished.Hopefully things will remain that way for years to come.\\\"\\n\\n\\n== Track listing ==\\nAll songs are produced by Left Brain, except \\\"Cigarillo\\\" produced by Hodgy Beats\\n\\n\\n== Chart positions ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\", \"rev_id\": 840911746, \"accessed\": \"2018-09-03 00:23:59.864295\", \"links\": [\"No Idols\", \"Pitchfork (website)\", \"The Odd Future Tape Vol. 2\", \"United States\", \"Curren$y\", \"Domo Genesis\", \"Numbers (Mellowhype album)\", \"Odd Future\", \"Smoke DZA\", \"Left Brain\", \"MellowHype\", \"Untitled 2 (EP)\", \"HipHopDX\", \"Odd Future Records\", \"Earl Sweatshirt\", \"Genesis (Domo Genesis album)\", \"Numbers (MellowHype album)\", \"Earl (mixtape)\", \"Lex Luger (producer)\", \"Remy Banks\", \"Wolf (Tyler, The Creator album)\", \"The Alchemist (musician)\", \"Hodgy\", \"XXL (magazine)\", \"The Odd Future Tape\", \"Pitchfork Media\", \"MellowHigh\", \"Hodgy Beats\", \"Respect.

The completion of the Los Angeles Aqueduct in 1913, delivering water from Eastern California, later assured the city's continued rapid growth.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\n\\n=== Pre-colonial period, up to 1771 ===\\nThe Los Angeles coastal area was settled by the Tongva (Gabrielenos) and Chumash tribes. A Gabrielino settlement in the area was called iyaanga (written Yang-na by the Spanish), meaning \\\"poison oak place.\\\"Maritime explorer Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo claimed the area of southern California for the Spanish Empire in 1542 while on an official military exploring expedition moving north along the Pacific coast from earlier colonizing bases of New Spain in Central and South America. Gaspar de Portola and Franciscan missionary Juan Crespi, reached the present site of Los Angeles on August 2, 1769.\\n\\n\\n=== Spanish period, 1771 to 1821 ===\\n\\nIn 1771, Franciscan friar Junipero Serra directed the building of the Mission San Gabriel Arcangel, the first mission in the area. On September 4, 1781, a group of forty-four settlers known as \\\"Los Pobladores\\\" founded the pueblo they called \\\"El Pueblo de Nuestra Senora la Reina de los Angeles\\\"; in English, this translates as \\\"The Town of Our Lady the Queen of the Angels\\\". The present-day city has the largest Roman Catholic Archdiocese in the United States. Two-thirds of the settlers were mestizo or mulatto with a mixture of African, indigenous and European ancestry. The settlement remained a small ranch town for decades, but by 1820, the population had increased to about 650 residents. Today, the pueblo is commemorated in the historic district of Los Angeles Pueblo Plaza and Olvera Street, the oldest part of Los Angeles.\\n\\n\\n=== Mexican period, 1821 to 1847 ===\\nNew Spain achieved its independence from the Spanish Empire in 1821, and the pueblo continued as a part of Mexico. During Mexican rule, Governor Pio Pico made Los Angeles Alta California's regional capital.\\n\\n\\n=== American period, 1847 to the present ===\\nMexican rule ended during the Mexican-American War: Americans took control from the Californios after a series of battles, culminating with the signing of the Treaty of Cahuenga on January 13, 1847.Railroads arrived with the completion of the transcontinental Southern Pacific line to Los Angeles in 1876 and the Santa Fe Railroad in 1885. Petroleum was discovered in the city and surrounding area in 1892, and by 1923, the discoveries had helped California become the country's largest oil producer, accounting for about one-quarter of the world's petroleum output.By 1900, the population had grown to more than 102,000, putting pressure on the city's water supply. The completion of the Los Angeles Aqueduct in 1913, under the supervision of William Mulholland, assured the continued growth of the city. Due to clauses in the city's charter that effectively prevented the City of Los Angeles from selling or providing water from the aqueduct to any area outside its borders, many adjacent city and communities became compelled to annex themselves into Los Angeles.Los Angeles created the first municipal zoning ordinance in the United States. On September 14, 1908, Los Angeles City Council promulgated residential and industrial land use zones. The new ordinance established three residential zones of a single type, where industrial uses were prohibited. The proscriptions included barns, lumber yards, and any industrial land use employing machine-powered equipment. These laws were enforced against industrial properties after-the-fact. These prohibitions were in addition to existing activities which were already regulated as nuisances. These included explosives warehousing, gas works, oil-drilling, slaughterhouses, and tanneries. Los Angeles City Council also designated seven industrial zones within the city. However, between 1908 and 1915, Los Angeles City Council created various exceptions to the broad proscriptions which applied to these three residential zones, and as a consequence, some industrial uses emerged within them. There are two differences from the 1908 Residence District Ordinance and later zoning laws in the United States. First, the 1908 laws did not establish a comprehensive zoning map as the 1916 New York City Zoning Ordinance did. Second, the residential zones did not distinguish types of housing: it treated apartments, hotels, and detached-single-family housing equally.In 1910, Hollywood merged into Los Angeles, with 10 movie companies already operating in the city at the time. By 1921, more than 80 percent of the world's film industry was concentrated in L.A. The money generated by the industry kept the city insulated from much of the economic loss suffered by the rest of the country during the Great Depression.\\nBy 1930, the population surpassed one million. In 1932, the city hosted the Summer Olympics.\\nDuring World War II, Los Angeles was a major center of wartime manufacturing, such as shipbuilding and aircraft. Calship built hundreds of Liberty Ships and Victory Ships on Terminal Island, and the Los Angeles area was the headquarters of six of the country's major aircraft manufacturers (Douglas Aircraft Company, Hughes Aircraft, Lockheed, North American Aviation, Northrop Corporation, and Vultee).  During the war, more aircraft were produced in one year than in all the pre-war years since the Wright brothers flew the first airplane in 1903, combined. Manufacturing in Los Angeles skyrocketed, and as William S. Knudsen, of the National Defense Advisory Commission put it, \\\"We won because we smothered the enemy in an avalanche of production, the like of which he had never seen, nor dreamed possible.\\n\\nFollowing the end of World War II, Los Angeles grew more rapidly than ever, sprawling into the San Fernando Valley. The expansion of the Interstate Highway System during the 1950s and 1960s helped propel suburban growth and signaled the demise of the city's electrified rail system, once the world's largest.\\nThe 1960s saw race relations boil over into the Watts riots of 1965 which resulted in 34 deaths and over 1,000 injuries. In 1969, Los Angeles became the birthplace of the Internet, as the first ARPANET transmission was sent from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) to SRI in Menlo Park.In 1984, the city hosted the Summer Olympic Games for the second time. Despite being boycotted by 14 Communist countries, the 1984 Olympics became more financially successful than any previous, and the second Olympics to turn a profit until then - the other, according to an analysis of contemporary newspaper reports, being the 1932 Summer Olympics, also held in Los Angeles.Racial tensions erupted on April 29, 1992, with the acquittal by a Simi Valley jury of four Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) officers captured on videotape beating Rodney King, culminating in large-scale riots. The California Army National Guard, the U.S. Army, and the U.S. Marine Corps were called in to assist local police in curtailing the violence. The riots were the largest in U.S. history, causing approximately $1.3 billion in damage as well as 63 deaths and over 2,000 injuries.In 1994, the 6.7 Northridge earthquake shook the city, causing $12.5 billion in damage and 72 deaths. The century ended with the Rampart scandal, one of the most extensive documented cases of police misconduct in American history.In 2002, voters defeated efforts by the San Fernando Valley and Hollywood to secede from the city.Los Angeles will host the 2028 Summer Olympics and Paralympic Games, making Los Angeles the third city to host the Olympics three times.\\n\\n\\n== Geography ==\\n\\n\\n=== Cityscape ===\\n\\nThe city is divided into over 80 districts and neighborhoods, many of which were incorporated places or communities that merged into the city.  These neighborhoods were developed piecemeal, and are well-defined enough that the city has signage marking nearly all of them.More broadly, the city is divided into the following areas: Downtown Los Angeles, East Los Angeles and Northeast Los Angeles, South Los Angeles, the Harbor Area, Greater Hollywood, Wilshire, the Westside, and the San Fernando and Crescenta Valleys.\\n\\n\\n=== Overview ===\\n\\nThe city's street pattern generally follows a grid plan, with uniform block lengths and occasional roads that cut across blocks. However, this is complicated by rugged terrain, which has necessitated having different grids for each of the valleys that Los Angeles covers.  Major streets are designed to move large volumes of traffic through many parts of the city; many of which are extremely long: Sepulveda Boulevard is 43 miles (69 km) long, while Foothill Boulevard is over 60 miles (97 km) long, reaching as far east as San Bernardino.  Drivers in Los Angeles suffer from one of the worst rush hour periods in the world, according to an annual traffic index by navigation system maker, TomTom.  L.A. drivers spend an additional 92 hours in traffic each year.  During the peak rush hour there is 80% congestion, according to the index.Los Angeles is often characterized by the presence of low-rise buildings.  Outside of a few centers such as Downtown, Warner Center, Century City, Koreatown, Miracle Mile, Hollywood and Westwood, skyscrapers and high-rise buildings are not common.  The few skyscrapers that are built outside of those areas often stand out above the rest of the surrounding landscape. Most construction is done in separate units, rather than wall-to-wall.  That being said, downtown Los Angeles itself has many buildings over 30 stories, with fourteen over 50 stories, and two over 70 stories (the tallest buildings west of Chicago-see List of tallest buildings in Los Angeles).  Also, Los Angeles is increasingly becoming a city of apartments rather than single family dwellings, especially in the dense inner city and Westside neighborhoods.\\n\\n\\n==== Landmarks ====\\n\\nImportant landmarks in Los Angeles include the Hollywood Sign, Walt Disney Concert Hall, Capitol Records Building, the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels, Angels Flight, Grauman's Chinese Theatre, Dolby Theatre, Griffith Observatory, Getty Center, Getty Villa, the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Venice Canal Historic District and boardwalk, Theme Building, Bradbury Building, U.S. Bank Tower, Wilshire Grand Center, Hollywood Boulevard, Los Angeles City Hall, Hollywood Bowl, Battleship USS Iowa, Watts Towers, Staples Center, Dodger Stadium, and Olvera Street.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n=== Topography ===\\n\\nThe city of Los Angeles covers a total area of 502.7 square miles (1,302 km2), comprising 468.7 square miles (1,214 km2) of land and 34.0 square miles (88 km2) of water. The city extends for 44 miles (71 km) longitudinally and for 29 miles (47 km) latitudinally. The perimeter of the city is 342 miles (550 km).\\nLos Angeles is both flat and hilly. The highest point in the city proper is 5,074 ft (1,547 m) Mount Lukens, located at the northeastern end of the San Fernando Valley. The eastern end of the Santa Monica Mountains stretches from Downtown to the Pacific Ocean and separates the Los Angeles Basin from the San Fernando Valley. Other hilly parts of Los Angeles include the Mt. Washington area north of Downtown, eastern parts such as Boyle Heights, the Crenshaw district around the Baldwin Hills, and the San Pedro district.\\nSurrounding the city are much higher mountains. Immediately to the north lie the San Gabriel Mountains, which is a popular recreation area for Angelenos. Its high point is Mount San Antonio, locally known as Mount Baldy, which reaches 10,064 feet (3,068 m). Further afield, the highest point in the greater Los Angeles area is San Gorgonio Mountain, with a height of 11,503 feet (3,506 m).\\nThe Los Angeles River, which is largely seasonal, is the primary drainage channel. It was straightened and lined in 51 miles (82 km) of concrete by the Army Corps of Engineers to act as a flood control channel. The river begins in the Canoga Park district of the city, flows east from the San Fernando Valley along the north edge of the Santa Monica Mountains, and turns south through the city center, flowing to its mouth in the Port of Long Beach at the Pacific Ocean. The smaller Ballona Creek flows into the Santa Monica Bay at Playa del Rey.\\n\\n\\n=== Vegetation ===\\nLos Angeles is rich in native plant species partly because of its diversity of habitats, including beaches, wetlands, and mountains. The most prevalent plant communities are coastal sage scrub, chaparral shrubland, and riparian woodland. Native plants include: California poppy, matilija poppy, toyon, Ceanothus, Chamise, Coast Live Oak, sycamore, willow and Giant Wildrye. Many of these native species, such as the Los Angeles sunflower, have become so rare as to be considered endangered. Though it is not native to the area, the official tree of Los Angeles is the Coral Tree (Erythrina caffra) and the official flower of Los Angeles is the Bird of Paradise (Strelitzia reginae).Mexican Fan Palms, Canary Island Palms, Queen Palms, Date Palms, and California Fan Palms are common in the Los Angeles area, although only the last is native.\\n\\n\\n=== Geology ===\\nLos Angeles is subject to earthquakes because of its location on the Pacific Ring of Fire. The geologic instability has produced numerous faults, which cause approximately 10,000 earthquakes annually in Southern California, though most of them are too small to be felt. The strike-slip San Andreas Fault system is located at the boundary between the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate, and is vulnerable to the \\\"big one\\\", a potentially large and damaging event after the San Francisco earthquake in 1906. The Los Angeles basin and metropolitan area are also at risk from blind thrust earthquakes. Major earthquakes that have hit the Los Angeles area include the 1933 Long Beach, 1971 San Fernando, 1987 Whittier Narrows, and the 1994 Northridge events. Nevertheless, all but a few are of low intensity and are not felt. The USGS has released the UCERF California earthquake forecast which models earthquake occurrence in California. Parts of the city are also vulnerable to tsunamis; harbor areas were damaged by waves from Aleutian Islands earthquake in 1946, Valdivia earthquake in 1960, Alaska earthquake in 1964, Chile earthquake in 2010 and Japan earthquake and Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011.\\n\\n\\n=== Climate ===\\n\\nLos Angeles has a Mediterranean climate (Koppen climate classification Csb on the coast, Csa inland), and receives just enough annual precipitation to avoid Koppen's BSn (mild semi-arid climate) classification. Los Angeles has plenty of sunshine throughout the year, with an average of only 35 days with measurable precipitation annually. The coastal region around Los Angeles has a climate that is comparable to coastal areas of southeastern Spain such as Alicante or Elche, in temperature range and variation, in sunshine hours and as well as annual precipitation levels.\\nTemperatures in the coastal basin exceed 90 degF (32 degC) on a dozen or so days in the year, from one day a month in April, May, June and November to three days a month in July, August, October and to five days in September. Temperatures in the San Fernando and San Gabriel Valleys are considerably warmer. Temperatures are subject to substantial daily swings; in inland areas the difference between the average daily low and the average daily high is over 30 degF (17 degC). The average annual temperature of the sea is 63 degF (17 degC), from 58 degF (14 degC) in January to 68 degF (20 degC) in August. Hours of sunshine total more than 3,000 per year, from an average of 7 hours of sunshine per day in December to an average of 12 in July.The Los Angeles area is also subject to phenomena typical of a microclimate, causing extreme variations in temperature in close physical proximity to each other.  For instance, the average July maximum temperature at the Santa Monica Pier is 75 degF (24 degC) whereas it is 95 degF (35 degC) in Canoga Park. The city, like much of the southern California coast, is subject to a late spring/early summer weather phenomenon called \\\"June Gloom\\\".  This involves overcast or foggy skies in the morning which yield to sun by early afternoon.Downtown Los Angeles averages 14.93 in (379 mm) of precipitation annually, which mainly occurs during November through March, generally in the form of moderate rain showers, but sometimes as heavy rainfall during winter storms. Summer days are usually rainless. Rarely, an incursion of moist air from the south or east can bring brief thunderstorms in late summer, especially to the mountains. The coast gets slightly less rainfall, while the inland and mountain areas get considerably more. Years of average rainfall are rare. The usual pattern is year to year variability, with a short string of dry years of 5-10 in (130-250 mm) rainfall, followed by one or two wet years with more than 20 in (510 mm). Wet years are usually associated with warm water El Nino conditions in the Pacific, dry years with cooler water La Nina episodes. A series of rainy days can bring floods to the lowlands and mudslides to the hills, especially after wildfires have denuded the slopes.\\nBoth freezing temperatures and snowfall are extremely rare in the city basin and along the coast, with the last occurrence of a 32 degF (0 degC) reading at the downtown station being January 29, 1979; freezing temperatures occur nearly every year in valley locations while the mountains within city limits typically receive snowfall every winter. The greatest snowfall recorded in downtown Los Angeles was 2.0 inches (5 cm) on January 15, 1932. At the official downtown station, the highest recorded temperature is 113 degF (45 degC) on September 27, 2010, while the lowest is 28 degF (-2 degC), on January 4, 1949. During autumn and winter, Santa Ana winds sometimes bring much warmer and drier conditions to Los Angeles, and raise  wildfire risk.\\n\\n\\n=== Environmental issues ===\\n\\nA Gabrielino settlement in the area was called iyaanga (written Yang-na by the Spanish), which has been translated as \\\"poison oak place\\\". Yang-na has also been translated as \\\"the valley of smoke\\\". Owing to geography, heavy reliance on automobiles, and the Los Angeles/Long Beach port complex, Los Angeles suffers from air pollution in the form of smog. The Los Angeles Basin and the San Fernando Valley are susceptible to atmospheric inversion, which holds in the exhausts from road vehicles, airplanes, locomotives, shipping, manufacturing, and other sources.The smog season lasts from approximately May to October. While other large cities rely on rain to clear smog, Los Angeles gets only 15 inches (380 mm) of rain each year: pollution accumulates over many consecutive days. Issues of air quality in Los Angeles and other major cities led to the passage of early national environmental legislation, including the Clean Air Act. More recently, the state of California has led the nation in working to limit pollution by mandating low-emission vehicles. Smog is expected to continue to drop in the coming years because of aggressive steps to reduce it, which include electric and hybrid cars, improvements in mass transit, and other measures.\\nThe number of Stage 1 smog alerts in Los Angeles has declined from over 100 per year in the 1970s to almost zero in the new millennium. Despite improvement, the 2006 and 2007 annual reports of the American Lung Association ranked the city as the most polluted in the country with short-term particle pollution and year-round particle pollution. In 2008, the city was ranked the second most polluted and again had the highest year-round particulate pollution.  The city met its goal of providing 20 percent of the city's power from renewable sources in 2010. The American Lung Association's 2013 survey ranks the metro area as having the nation's worst smog, and fourth in both short-term and year-round pollution amounts.Los Angeles is also home to the nation's largest urban oil field. There are more than 700 active oil wells located within 1,500 feet of homes, churches, schools and hospitals in the city, a situation about which the EPA has voiced serious concerns.\\n\\n\\n== Demographics ==\\n\\nThe 2010 United States Census reported that Los Angeles had a population of 3,792,621. The population density was 8,092.3 people per square mile (2,913.0/km2). The age distribution was 874,525 people (23.1%) under 18, 434,478 people (11.5%) from 18 to 24, 1,209,367 people (31.9%) from 25 to 44, 877,555 people (23.1%) from 45 to 64, and 396,696 people (10.5%) who were 65 or older. The median age was 34.1 years. For every 100 females, there were 99.2 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 97.6 males.There were 1,413,995 housing units--up from 1,298,350 during 2005-2009--at an average density of 2,812.8 households per square mile (1,086.0/km2), of which 503,863 (38.2%) were owner-occupied, and 814,305 (61.8%) were occupied by renters. The homeowner vacancy rate was 2.1%; the rental vacancy rate was 6.1%. 1,535,444 people (40.5% of the population) lived in owner-occupied housing units and 2,172,576 people (57.3%) lived in rental housing units.According to the 2010 United States Census, Los Angeles had a median household income of $49,497, with 22.0% of the population living below the federal poverty line.\\n\\n\\n=== Race and ethnicity ===\\n\\nAccording to the 2010 Census, the racial makeup of Los Angeles included: 1,888,158 Whites (49.8%), 365,118 African Americans (9.6%), 28,215 Native Americans (0.7%), 426,959 Asians (11.3%), 5,577 Pacific Islanders (0.1%), 902,959 from other races (23.8%), and 175,635 (4.6%) from two or more races. Hispanics or Latinos of any race were 1,838,822 persons (48.5%).\\nLos Angeles is home to people from more than 140 countries speaking 224 different identified languages. Ethnic enclaves like Chinatown, Historic Filipinotown, Koreatown, Little Armenia, Little Ethiopia, Tehrangeles, Little Tokyo, Little Bangladesh, and Thai Town provide examples of the polyglot character of Los Angeles.\\nNon-Hispanic whites were 28.7% of the population in 2010, compared to 86.3% in 1940. The majority of the Non-Hispanic white population is living in areas along the Pacific coast as well as in neighborhoods near and on the Santa Monica Mountains from the Pacific Palisades to Los Feliz.\\nMexican ancestry make up the largest ethnic group of Hispanics at 31.9% of Los Angeles's population, followed by those of Salvadoran (6.0%) and Guatemalan (3.6%) heritage. The Hispanic population has a long established Mexican-American and Central American community and is spread well-nigh throughout the entire city of Los Angeles and its metropolitan area. It is most heavily concentrated in regions around Downtown as East Los Angeles, Northeast Los Angeles and Westlake. Furthermore, a vast majority of residents in neighborhoods in eastern South Los Angeles towards Downey are of Hispanic origin.\\nThe largest Asian ethnic groups are Filipinos (3.2%) and Koreans (2.9%), which have their own established ethnic enclaves-Koreatown in the Wilshire Center and Historic Filipinotown. Chinese people, which make up 1.8% of Los Angeles's population, reside mostly outside of Los Angeles city limits and rather in the San Gabriel Valley of eastern Los Angeles County, but make a sizable presence in the city, notably in Chinatown. Chinatown and Thaitown are also home to many Thais and Cambodians, which make up 0.3% and 0.1% of Los Angeles's population, respectively. Japanese comprise 0.9% of L.A.'s population, and have an established Little Tokyo in the city's downtown, and another significant community of Japanese Americans is located in the Sawtelle district of West Los Angeles. Vietnamese make up 0.5% of Los Angeles's population. Indians make up 0.9% of the city's population.\\nThe Los Angeles metropolitan area is home to a large population of Armenians and Iranians, many of whom live in enclaves like Little Armenia and Tehrangeles.\\n\\nAfrican Americans have been the predominant ethnic group in South Los Angeles, which has emerged as the largest African American community in the western United States since the 1960s. The neighborhoods of South LA with highest concentration of African Americans include Crenshaw, Baldwin Hills, Leimert Park, Hyde Park, Gramercy Park, Manchester Square and Watts. Apart from South Los Angeles, neighborhoods in the Central region of Los Angeles, as Mid-City and Mid-Wilshire have a moderate concentration of African Americans as well. In 1970, the Census Bureau reported the city's population as 17.9% black, 61.1% non-Hispanic white and 17.1% Hispanic.\\n\\n\\n=== Religion ===\\n\\nAccording to a 2014 study by the Pew Research Center, Christianity is the most prevalently practiced religion in Los Angeles (65%). Perhaps owing to the fact of its founding by Franciscan friars of Roman Catholicism, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Los Angeles leads the largest archdiocese in the country. Cardinal Roger Mahony oversaw construction of the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels, which opened in September 2002 in downtown Los Angeles. Construction of the cathedral marked a coming of age of the city's Catholic, heavily Latino community. There are numerous Catholic churches and parishes throughout Los Angeles.\\nIn 2011, the once common, but ultimately lapsed, custom of conducting a procession and Mass in honor of Nuestra Senora de los Angeles, in commemoration of the founding of the City of Los Angeles in 1781, was revived by the Queen of Angels Foundation and its founder Mark Albert, with the support and approbation of the Archdiocese of Los Angeles as well as several civic leaders. The recently revived custom is a continuation of the original processions and Masses which commenced on the first anniversary of the founding of Los Angeles in 1782 and continued for nearly a century thereafter.\\nWith 621,000 Jews in the metropolitan area (490,000 in city proper), the region has the second largest population of Jews in the United States. Many of Los Angeles's Jews now live on the Westside and in the San Fernando Valley, though Boyle Heights and Northwest Los Angeles once had large Jewish populations. Many varieties of Judaism are represented in the area, including Reform, Conservative, Orthodox, and Reconstructionist. The Breed Street Shul in East Los Angeles, built in 1923, was the largest synagogue west of Chicago in its early decades. (It is no longer a sacred space and is being converted to a museum and community center.) The Kabbalah Centre also has a presence in the city.The International Church of the Foursquare Gospel was founded in Los Angeles by Aimee Semple McPherson in 1923 and remains headquartered there to this day.  For many years, the church convened at Angelus Temple, which, when built, was one of the largest churches in the country.Los Angeles has had a rich and influential Protestant tradition. The first Protestant service in Los Angeles was a Methodist meeting held in a private home in 1850 and the oldest Protestant church still operating, First Congregational Church, was founded in 1867. In the early 1900s the Bible Institute Of Los Angeles published the founding documents of the Christian Fundamentalist movement and the Azusa Street Revival launched Pentecostalism. The Metropolitan Community Church also had its origins in the Los Angeles area.  Important churches in the city include First Presbyterian Church of Hollywood, Bel Air Presbyterian Church, First African Methodist Episcopal Church of Los Angeles, West Angeles Church of God in Christ, Second Baptist Church, Crenshaw Christian Center, McCarty Memorial Christian Church, and First Congregational Church.\\nThe Los Angeles California Temple, the second largest temple operated by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, is on Santa Monica Boulevard in the Westwood neighborhood of Los Angeles. Dedicated in 1956, it was the first LDS temple built in California and it was the largest in the world when completed.The Hollywood region of Los Angeles also has several significant headquarters, churches, and the Celebrity Center of Scientology.Because of Los Angeles's large multi-ethnic population, a wide variety of faiths are practiced, including Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, Zoroastrianism, Sikhism, Baha'i, various Eastern Orthodox Churches, Sufism and others. Immigrants from Asia for example, have formed a number of significant Buddhist congregations making the city home to the greatest variety of Buddhists in the world.  The first Buddhist joss house was founded in the city in 1875. Atheism and other secular beliefs are also common, as the city is the largest in the Western U.S. Unchurched Belt.\\n\\n\\n== Economy ==\\n\\nThe economy of Los Angeles is driven by international trade, entertainment (television, motion pictures, video games, music recording, and production), aerospace, technology, petroleum, fashion, apparel, and tourism. Other significant industries include finance, telecommunications, law, healthcare, and transportation. In the 2017 Global Financial Centres Index, Los Angeles was ranked as having the 19th most competitive financial center in the world, and sixth most competitive in United States (after New York City, San Francisco, Chicago, Boston, and Washington, D.C.).Two of the six major film studios, Paramount Pictures and 20th Century Fox, are located within the city limits, their locations being part of the so-called \\\"Thirty-Mile Zone\\\" of entertainment headquarters in Southern California.\\nLos Angeles is the largest manufacturing center in the western United States. The contiguous ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach together comprise the fifth-busiest port in the world and the most significant port in the Western Hemisphere and is vital to trade within the Pacific Rim.The Los Angeles-Long Beach metropolitan area has a gross metropolitan product of $866 billion (as of  2015), making it the third-largest economic metropolitan area in the world, after Tokyo and New York. Los Angeles has been classified an \\\"Alpha world city\\\" according to a 2012 study by a group at Loughborough University.The largest employers in the city as of  2009 were, in descending order, the City of Los Angeles, the County of Los Angeles, and University of California, Los Angeles. The University of Southern California (USC) is the city's fourth largest employer and the largest private sector employer.\\n\\n\\n=== Corporate headquarters ===\\nAs of 2018, Los Angeles is home to three companies in the Fortune 500.\\n\\n\\n== Culture ==\\n\\nLos Angeles is often billed as the \\\"Creative Capital of the World\\\", because one in every six of its residents works in a creative industry and there are more artists, writers, filmmakers, actors, dancers and musicians living and working in Los Angeles than any other city at any time in history.\\n\\n\\n=== Movies and the performing arts ===\\nThe city's Hollywood neighborhood has become recognized as the center of the motion picture industry and the Los Angeles area is also associated as being the center of the television industry. The city is home to the major film studios as well as major record labels. Los Angeles plays host to the annual Academy Awards, the Primetime Emmy Awards, the Grammy Awards as well as many other entertainment industry awards shows. Los Angeles is the site of the USC School of Cinematic Arts, the oldest film school in the United States.\\n\\nThe performing arts play a major role in Los Angeles's cultural identity. According to the USC Stevens Institute for Innovation, \\\"there are more than 1,100 annual theatrical productions and 21 openings every week.\\\" The Los Angeles Music Center is \\\"one of the three largest performing arts centers in the nation\\\", with more than 1.3 million visitors per year. The Walt Disney Concert Hall, centerpiece of the Music Center, is home to the prestigious Los Angeles Philharmonic. Notable organizations such as Center Theatre Group, the Los Angeles Master Chorale, and the Los Angeles Opera are also resident companies of the Music Center. Talent is locally cultivated at premier institutions such as the Colburn School and the USC Thornton School of Music.\\n\\n\\n=== Museums and galleries ===\\n\\nThere are 841 museums and art galleries in Los Angeles County. In fact, Los Angeles has more museums per capita than any other city in the world. Some of the notable museums are the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (the largest art museum in the Western United States), the Getty Center (part of the J. Paul Getty Trust, the world's wealthiest art institution), the Petersen Automotive Museum, the Huntington Library, the Natural History Museum, the Battleship Iowa, and the Museum of Contemporary Art. A significant number of art galleries are located on Gallery Row, and tens of thousands attend the monthly Downtown Art Walk there.\\n\\n\\n== Sports ==\\n\\nThe city of Los Angeles and its metropolitan area are the home of eleven top level professional sports teams.  These teams include the Los Angeles Dodgers and Los Angeles Angels of Major League Baseball (MLB), the Los Angeles Rams and the Los Angeles Chargers of the National Football League (NFL), the Los Angeles Lakers and Los Angeles Clippers of the National Basketball Association (NBA), the Los Angeles Kings and Anaheim Ducks of the National Hockey League (NHL), the Los Angeles Galaxy and Los Angeles FC of Major League Soccer (MLS), and the Los Angeles Sparks of the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA).\\n\\nOther notable sports teams include the UCLA Bruins and the USC Trojans in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), both of which are Division I teams in the Pac-12 Conference.\\nLos Angeles is the second-largest city in the United States but hosted no NFL team between 1995 and 2015. At one time, the Los Angeles area hosted two NFL teams: the Rams and the Raiders. Both left the city in 1995, with the Rams moving to St. Louis, and the Raiders moving back to their original home of Oakland. After 21 seasons in St. Louis, on January 12, 2016, the NFL announced that the Rams would be moving back to Los Angeles for the 2016 NFL season. A new stadium will be built in Inglewood, California for the team by the 2020 season. Prior to 1995, the Rams played their home games in the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum from 1946 to 1979 and the Raiders played their home games at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum from 1982 to 1994. The San Diego Chargers announced on January 12, 2017 that they would relocate to Los Angeles and become the Los Angeles Chargers beginning in the 2017 NFL season and play at the StubHub Center in Carson, California for the next three seasons until the Rams' Inglewood stadium is completed.\\n\\nLos Angeles has twice hosted the Summer Olympic Games: in 1932 and in 1984, and will host the games for a third time in 2028.  Los Angeles will be the third city after London (1908, 1948 and 2012) and Paris (1900, 1924 and 2024) to host the Olympic Games three times. When the tenth Olympic Games were hosted in 1932, the former 10th Street was renamed Olympic Blvd. Super Bowls I and VII were also held in the city, as well as multiple FIFA World Cup games at the Rose Bowl in 1994, including the final. Los Angeles also hosted the Deaflympics in 1985 and Special Olympics World Summer Games in 2015.Los Angeles boasts a number of sports venues, including Dodger Stadium, the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, Banc of California Stadium and the Staples Center. The Forum, the StubHub Center, and the Rose Bowl are also located in adjacent cities.\\n\\n\\n== Government ==\\n\\nLos Angeles is a charter city as opposed to a general law city. The current charter was adopted on June 8, 1999 and has been amended many times since then. The elected government consists of the Los Angeles City Council and the Mayor of Los Angeles which operate under a mayor-council government, as well as the city attorney (not to be confused with the district attorney, a county office) and controller. The current mayor is Eric Garcetti. There are 15 city council districts.\\nThe city has many departments and appointed officers, including the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD), the Los Angeles Board of Police Commissioners, the Los Angeles Fire Department (LAFD), the Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles (HACLA), the Los Angeles Department of Transportation (LADOT), and the Los Angeles Public Library (LAPL).\\nThe Charter of the City of Los Angeles ratified by voters in 1999 created a system of advisory neighborhood councils that would represent the diversity of stakeholders, defined as those who live, work or own property in the neighborhood. The neighborhood councils are relatively autonomous and spontaneous in that they identify their own boundaries, establish their own bylaws, and elect their own officers. There are currently about 90 neighborhood councils.\\nResidents of Los Angeles elect supervisors for the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th supervisorial districts.\\n\\n\\n=== Federal and state representation ===\\nIn the California State Assembly, Los Angeles is split between fourteen districts. In the California State Senate, the city is split between eight districts. In the United States House of Representatives, it is split between ten congressional districts.\\n\\n\\n=== Crime ===\\n\\nLos Angeles experienced a significant decline in crime in the 1990s and late 2000s and reached a 50-year low in 2009 with 314 homicides. This is a rate of 7.85 per 100,000 population--a major decrease from 1980 when a homicide rate of 34.2 per 100,000 was reported. This included 15 officer-involved shootings. One shooting led to the death of a SWAT team member, Randal Simmons, the first in LAPD's history. Los Angeles in the year of 2013 totaled 251 murders, a decrease of 16 percent from the previous year. Police speculate that the drop resulted from a number of factors, including young people spending more time online. Crime increased significantly in 2015 from the low in 2013 with the rate of aggravated assault up 76%, rape up 182.7% and murder up 9.2%.The Dragna crime family and the Cohen crime family dominated organized crime in the city during the Prohibition era and reached its peak during the 1940s and 1950s with the battle of Sunset Strip as part of the American Mafia, but has gradually declined since then with the rise of various black and Hispanic gangs in the late 1960s and early 1970s.According to the Los Angeles Police Department, the city is home to 45,000 gang members, organized into 450 gangs. Among them are the Crips and Bloods, which are both African American street gangs that originated in the South Los Angeles region. Latino street gangs such as the Surenos, a Mexican American street gang, and Mara Salvatrucha, which has mainly members of Salvadoran descent, all originated in Los Angeles. This has led to the city being referred to as the \\\"Gang Capital of America\\\".\\n\\n\\n== Education ==\\n\\n\\n=== Colleges and universities ===\\n\\nThere are three public universities located within the city limits: California State University, Los Angeles (CSULA), California State University, Northridge (CSUN) and University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA).\\n\\nPrivate colleges in the city include the American Film Institute Conservatory, Alliant International University, American Academy of Dramatic Arts (Los Angeles Campus), American Jewish University, Abraham Lincoln University, The American Musical and Dramatic Academy - Los Angeles campus, Antioch University's Los Angeles campus, Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and Science, Emperor's College, Fashion Institute of Design & Merchandising's Los Angeles campus (FIDM), Los Angeles Film School, Loyola Marymount University (LMU is also the parent university of Loyola Law School located in Los Angeles), Marymount College, Mount St. Mary's College, National University of California, Occidental College (\\\"Oxy\\\"), Otis College of Art and Design (Otis), Southern California Institute of Architecture (SCI-Arc), Southwestern Law School, University of Southern California (USC), and Woodbury University.\\nThe community college system consists of nine campuses governed by the trustees of the Los Angeles Community College District: East Los Angeles College (ELAC), Los Angeles City College (LACC), Los Angeles Harbor College, Los Angeles Mission College, Los Angeles Pierce College, Los Angeles Valley College (LAVC), Los Angeles Southwest College, Los Angeles Trade-Technical College and West Los Angeles College.\\nThere are numerous additional colleges and universities outside the city limits in the Greater Los Angeles area.\\n\\n\\n=== Schools and libraries ===\\n\\nLos Angeles Unified School District serves almost all of the city of Los Angeles, as well as several surrounding communities, with a student population around 800,000. After Proposition 13 was approved in 1978, urban school districts had considerable trouble with funding. LAUSD has become known for its underfunded, overcrowded and poorly maintained campuses, although its 162 Magnet schools help compete with local private schools.\\nSeveral small sections of Los Angeles are in the Las Virgenes Unified School District. The Los Angeles County Office of Education operates the Los Angeles County High School for the Arts. The Los Angeles Public Library system operates 72 public libraries in the city. Enclaves of unincorporated areas are served by branches of the County of Los Angeles Public Library, many of which are within walking distance to residents.\\n\\n\\n== Media ==\\n\\nThe Los Angeles metro area is the second-largest broadcast designated market area in the U.S. (after New York) with 5,431,140 homes (4.956% of the U.S.), which is served by a wide variety of local AM and FM radio and television stations. Los Angeles and New York City are the only two media markets to have seven VHF allocations assigned to them.As part of the region's aforementioned creative industry, the Big Four major broadcast television networks, ABC, CBS, Fox, and NBC, all have production facilities and offices throughout various areas of Los Angeles. All four major broadcast television networks, plus major Spanish-language networks Telemundo and Univision, also own and operate stations that both serve the Los Angeles market and serve as each network's West Coast flagship station: ABC's KABC-TV (Channel 7), CBS's KCBS-TV (Channel 2), Fox's KTTV-TV (Channel 11), NBC's KNBC-TV (Channel 4), MyNetworkTV's KCOP-TV (channel 13), Telemundo's KVEA-TV (Channel 52), and Univision's KMEX-TV (Channel 34).

The Texas Transportation Institute, which publishes an annual Urban Mobility Report, ranked Los Angeles road traffic as the most congested in the United States in 2005 as measured by annual delay per traveler. The average traveler in Los Angeles experienced 72 hours of traffic delay per year according to the study. Los Angeles was followed by San Francisco/Oakland, Washington, D.C. and Atlanta, (each with 60 hours of delay). Despite the congestion in the city, the mean travel time for commuters in Los Angeles is shorter than other major cities, including New York City, Philadelphia and Chicago. Los Angeles's mean travel time for work commutes in 2006 was 29.2 minutes, similar to those of San Francisco and Washington, D.C.Among the major highways that connect LA to the rest of the nation include Interstate 5, which runs south through San Diego to Tijuana in Mexico and north through Sacramento, Portland, and Seattle to the Canada-US border; Interstate 10, the southernmost east-west, coast-to-coast Interstate Highway in the United States, going to Jacksonville, Florida; and U.S. Route 101, which heads to the California Central Coast, San Francisco, the Redwood Empire, and the Oregon and Washington coasts.\\n\\n\\n=== Transit systems ===\\n\\nThe LA County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (LA County Metro) and other agencies operate an extensive system of bus lines, as well as subway and light rail lines across Los Angeles County, with a combined monthly ridership (measured in individual boardings) of 38.8 million as of September 2011. The majority of this (30.5 million) is taken up by the city's bus system, the second busiest in the country. The subway and light rail combined average the remaining roughly 8.2 million boardings per month. LA County Metro recorded over 397 million boardings for the 2017 calendar year, including about 285 million bus riders and about 113 million riding on rail transit. For the first quarter of 2018, there were just under 95 million system-wide boardings, down from about 98 million in 2017, and about 105 million in 2016. In 2005, 10.2% of Los Angeles commuters rode some form of public transportation. According to the 2016 American Community Survey, 9.2% of working Los Angeles (city) residents made the journey to work via public transportation.The city's subway system is the ninth busiest in the United States and its light rail system is the country's busiest. The rail system includes the Red and Purple subway lines, as well as the Gold, Blue, Expo, and Green light rail lines. In 2016, the Expo Line was extended to the Pacific at Santa Monica. The Metro Orange and Silver lines are bus rapid transit lines with stops and frequency similar to those of light rail. As of 2018, the total number of light rail stations is 93. The city is also central to the commuter rail system Metrolink, which links Los Angeles to all neighboring counties as well as many suburbs.\\n\\nBesides the rail service provided by Metrolink and the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority, Los Angeles is served by inter-city passenger trains from Amtrak.

On the northwest, it omits a section of Los Angeles west of La Brea Avenue.  On the southwest, it includes a section of Inglewood north of Century Boulevard.\\n\\n\\n== Districts and neighborhoods ==\\n\\n\\n=== City of Los Angeles ===\\nAccording to the Mapping L.A. survey of the Los Angeles Times, the South Los Angeles region consists of the following:\\n\\n\\n=== Unincorporated county ===\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\n\\n=== Pre-1948 ===\\nSouth L.A. is home to the University of Southern California, founded in 1880, as well as the Doheny Campus of Mount St. Mary's College, which was founded in 1920. The 1932 and 1984 Olympic Games took place near the USC campus at neighboring Exposition Park, which hosts the Los Angeles Coliseum. Until the 1920s, West Adams was one of the most desirable areas of the city. Then development of the Wilshire Boulevard corridor drew Los Angeles' development west of downtown. As the wealthy were building stately mansions in West Adams and Jefferson Park, the white working class was establishing itself in Crenshaw and Hyde Park. Affluent blacks gradually moved into West Adams and Jefferson Park as the decades passed.At the same time, the area of modest bungalows and low-rise commercial buildings along Central Avenue emerged as the heart of the black community in southern California. It had one of the first jazz scenes in the western U.S., with trombonist Kid Ory a prominent resident. Under racially restrictive covenants, blacks were allowed to own property only within the Main-Slauson-Alameda-Washington box and in Watts, as well as in small enclaves elsewhere in the city. The working- and middle-class blacks who poured into Los Angeles during the Great Depression and in search of jobs during World War II found themselves penned into what was becoming a severely overcrowded neighborhood. During the war, blacks faced such dire housing shortages that the Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles built the virtually all-black and Latino Pueblo Del Rio project, designed by Richard Neutra.\\n\\n\\n=== 1948-1960s ===\\nWhen the Supreme Court banned the legal enforcement of race-oriented restrictive covenants in 1948's Shelley v. Kraemer, blacks began to move into areas outside the increasingly overcrowded Slauson-Alameda-Washington-Main settlement area. For a time in the early 1950s, southern Los Angeles became the site of significant racial violence, with whites bombing, firing into, and burning crosses on the lawns of homes purchased by black families south of Slauson. In an escalation of behavior that began in the 1920s, white gangs in nearby cities such as South Gate and Huntington Park routinely accosted blacks who traveled through white areas. The black mutual protection clubs that formed in response to these assaults became the basis of the region's fearsome street gangs.As in most urban areas, 1950s freeway construction radically altered the geography of southern Los Angeles. Freeway routes tended to reinforce traditional segregation lines.\\n\\n\\n=== 1970s-1990s ===\\n\\nBeginning in the 1970s, the rapid decline of the area's manufacturing base resulted in a loss of the jobs that had allowed skilled union workers to have a middle class life. Downtown Los Angeles' service sector, which had long been dominated by unionized African Americans earning relatively high wages, replaced most black workers with newly arrived Mexican and Central American immigrants.Widespread unemployment, poverty and street crime contributed to the rise of street gangs in South Central, such as the Crips and Bloods. They became even more powerful with money from drugs, especially the crack cocaine trade, dominated by gangs in the 1980s.\\n\\n\\n=== 2000s-present ===\\nBy the early 2000s, the crime rate of South L.A. has lowered significantly. Current redevelopment, improved police patrol, community-based peace programs, gang intervention work, and youth development organizations lowered the murder and crime rates to levels that have not been seen since the 1940s and '50s. Nevertheless, South Los Angeles is still known for its gangs at the time.\\nIn mid 2003, the City of Los Angeles officially changed the region's name from South Central to South Los Angeles, a move supporters said would \\\"help erase a stigma that has dogged the southern part of the city.\\\"On August 11, 2014, just two days after the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, a resident of South Los Angeles, Ezell Ford, described as \\\"a mentally ill 25-year-old man\\\", was fatally shot by two Los Angeles police officers (see Shooting of Ezell Ford). Since then, a number of protests focused on events in Ferguson have taken place in South Los Angeles.\\n\\n\\n== Demographics ==\\nBy the end of the 1980s, South Los Angeles had an increasing number of Hispanics and Latinos, mostly in the northeastern section of the region.\\\"Between 1970 and 1990 the South LA area went from 80% black and 9% Latino to 50.3% black and 44% Latino.\\\" This massive and rapid residential demographic change occurred as resources in the area were shrinking due to global economic restructuring described above and due to the federal government's decrease in funding of urban anti-poverty and jobs programs, and other vital social services like healthcare. The socio-economic context described here increased the perception and the reality of competition amongst Asians, blacks, and Latinos in South LA. The results from the 2000 census which show continuing demographic change coupled with recent economic trends indicating a deterioration of conditions in South LA suggest that such competition will not soon ease.\\\"In the 2010 census, the area of South Los Angeles had a population of about 768,456.  64.0% of the residents were Hispanic or Latino, nearly 31.4% were African American.\\n\\n\\n== Education ==\\nSouth Los Angeles is home to the University of Southern California, a private research university in the University Park neighborhood. It is California's oldest private research university.\\n\\n\\n=== Public schools ===\\nAlmost all of the South Los Angeles Area is served by the Los Angeles Unified School District. There are some schools not within the LAUSD reach that also serve the South Los Angeles Area, such as independent private schools.\\n\\n\\n=== Los Angeles Unified School District ===\\nThe following are some of the schools under the LAUSD which fall within the boundaries of the South Los Angeles region.\\nLAUSD Elementary Schools \\nColiseum Street Elementary\\nGraham Elementary\\nGrape Street Elementary\\nManchester Avenue Elementary\\nRussell Elementary\\n68th Street Elementary\\n75th Street Elementary\\n107th Street Elementary\\n109th Street Elementary\\n112th Street Elementary\\n116th Street Elementary\\n118th Street ElementaryLAUSD Middle Schools\\nAudubon Middle School\\nCharles Drew Middle School\\nEdwin Markham Middle School\\nMary McLeod Bethune Middle School\\nSamuel Gompers Middle School\\nThomas Edison Middle SchoolLAUSD High Schools\\nCrenshaw High School\\nDavid Starr Jordan High School\\nSusan Miller Dorsey High School\\nLocke High School\\nDiego Rivera Learning Complex\\nJohn C Fremont High School\\nKing-Drew Senior  High Medicine and Science Magnet\\nMervyn M Dymally Senior High\\nNathaniel Narbonne Senior High\\n\\n\\n=== Community Colleges ===\\nLos Angeles Southwest College\\n\\n\\n=== Universities ===\\nUniversity of Southern California\\n\\n\\n== Landmarks ==\\n\\n\\n=== Former landmarks ===\\n\\n\\n== Notable people ==\\n\\n\\n=== Music and entertainment ===\\n\\n\\n=== Sports and athletes ===\\n\\n\\n=== Politicians ===\\n\\n\\n=== Artists, filmmakers and writers ===\", \"rev_id\": 857215157, \"accessed\": \"2018-09-03 00:23:59.864295\", \"links\": [\"Bloods\", \"Los Angeles City Council\", \"Wilshire Boulevard\", \"Exposition Park (Los Angeles)\", \"Los Angeles County, California\", \"Los Angeles\", \"Great Depression\", \"Locke High School\", \"Richard Neutra\", \"John C Fremont High School\", \"Ferguson, Missouri\", \"Pueblo Del Rio\", \"University\", \"Los Angeles Times\", \"Mapping L.A.\", \"Baldwin Hills (mountain range)\", \"Central Avenue (Los Angeles)\", \"Susan Miller Dorsey High School\", \"Los Angeles Unified School District\", \"Crenshaw High School\", \"Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles\", \"Los Angeles Coliseum\", \"World War II\", \"LAUSD\", \"University of Southern California\", \"Kid Ory\", \"Central America\", \"Shooting of Ezell Ford\", \"Google\", \"David Starr Jordan High School\", \"Downtown Los Angeles\", \"Freeway\", \"California\", \"Shelley v.

Jack Dorsey, then an undergraduate student at New York University, introduced the idea of an individual using an SMS service to communicate with a small group. The original project code name for the service was twttr, an idea that Williams later ascribed to Noah Glass, inspired by Flickr and the five-character length of American SMS short codes. The decision was also partly due to the fact that the domain twitter.com was already in use, and it was six months after the launch of twttr that the crew purchased the domain and changed the name of the service to Twitter. The developers initially considered \\\"10958\\\" as a short code, but later changed it to \\\"40404\\\" for \\\"ease of use and memorability\\\". Work on the project started on March 21, 2006, when Dorsey published the first Twitter message at 9:50 p.m. Pacific Standard Time (PST): \\\"just setting up my twttr\\\". Dorsey has explained the origin of the \\\"Twitter\\\" title:\\n\\n...we came across the word 'twitter', and it was just perfect. The definition was 'a short burst of inconsequential information,' and 'chirps from birds'. And that's exactly what the product was.\\nThe first Twitter prototype, developed by Dorsey and contractor Florian Weber, was used as an internal service for Odeo employees and the full version was introduced publicly on July 15, 2006. In October 2006, Biz Stone, Evan Williams, Dorsey, and other members of Odeo formed Obvious Corporation and acquired Odeo, together with its assets -- including Odeo.com and Twitter.com -- from the investors and shareholders. Williams fired Glass, who was silent about his part in Twitter's startup until 2011. Twitter spun off into its own company in April 2007. Williams provided insight into the ambiguity that defined this early period in a 2013 interview:\\n\\nWith Twitter, it wasn't clear what it was. They called it a social network, they called it microblogging, but it was hard to define, because it didn't replace anything. There was this path of discovery with something like that, where over time you figure out what it is. Twitter actually changed from what we thought it was in the beginning, which we described as status updates and a social utility. It is that, in part, but the insight we eventually came to was Twitter was really more of an information network than it is a social network.\\nThe tipping point for Twitter's popularity was the 2007 South by Southwest Interactive (SXSWi) conference. During the event, Twitter usage increased from 20,000 tweets per day to 60,000. \\\"The Twitter people cleverly placed two 60-inch plasma screens in the conference hallways, exclusively streaming Twitter messages,\\\" remarked Newsweek's Steven Levy. \\\"Hundreds of conference-goers kept tabs on each other via constant twitters. Panelists and speakers mentioned the service, and the bloggers in attendance touted it.\\\" Reaction at the conference was highly positive. Blogger Scott Beale said that Twitter was \\\"absolutely ruling\\\" SXSWi. Social software researcher danah boyd said Twitter was \\\"owning\\\" the conference. Twitter staff received the festival's Web Award prize with the remark \\\"we'd like to thank you in 140 characters or less. And we just did!\\\"The first unassisted off-Earth Twitter message was posted from the International Space Station by NASA astronaut T. J. Creamer on January 22, 2010. By late November 2010, an average of a dozen updates per day were posted on the astronauts' communal account, @NASA_Astronauts. NASA has also hosted over 25 \\\"tweetups\\\", events that provide guests with VIP access to NASA facilities and speakers with the goal of leveraging participants' social networks to further the outreach goals of NASA. In August 2010, the company appointed Adam Bain from News Corp.'s Fox Audience Network as president of revenue.\\n\\n\\n=== Growth ===\\nThe company experienced rapid initial growth. It had 400,000 tweets posted per quarter in 2007. This grew to 100 million tweets posted per quarter in 2008. In February 2010, Twitter users were sending 50 million tweets per day. By March 2010, the company recorded over 70,000 registered applications. As of June 2010, about 65 million tweets were posted each day, equaling about 750 tweets sent each second, according to Twitter. As of March 2011, that was about 140 million tweets posted daily. As noted on Compete.com, Twitter moved up to the third-highest-ranking social networking site in January 2009 from its previous rank of twenty-second.\\n\\nTwitter's usage spikes during prominent events. For example, a record was set during the 2010 FIFA World Cup when fans wrote 2,940 tweets per second in the thirty-second period after Japan scored against Cameroon on June 14. The record was broken again when 3,085 tweets per second were posted after the Los Angeles Lakers' victory in the 2010 NBA Finals on June 17, and then again at the close of Japan's victory over Denmark in the World Cup when users published 3,283 tweets per second. The record was set again during the 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup Final between Japan and the United States, when 7,196 tweets per second were published. When American singer Michael Jackson died on June 25, 2009, Twitter servers crashed after users were updating their status to include the words \\\"Michael Jackson\\\" at a rate of 100,000 tweets per hour. The current record as of August 3, 2013 was set in Japan, with 143,199 tweets per second during a television screening of the movie Castle in the Sky (beating the previous record of 33,388, also set by Japan for the television screening of the same movie).Twitter acquired application developer Atebits on April 11, 2010. Atebits had developed the Apple Design Award-winning Twitter client Tweetie for the Mac and iPhone. The application, now called \\\"Twitter\\\" and distributed free of charge, is the official Twitter client for the iPhone, iPad and Mac.From September through October 2010, the company began rolling out \\\"New Twitter\\\", an entirely revamped edition of twitter.com. Changes included the ability to see pictures and videos without leaving Twitter itself by clicking on individual tweets which contain links to images and clips from a variety of supported websites including YouTube and Flickr, and a complete overhaul of the interface, which shifted links such as '@mentions' and 'Retweets' above the Twitter stream, while 'Messages' and 'Log Out' became accessible via a black bar at the very top of twitter.com. As of November 1, 2010, the company confirmed that the \\\"New Twitter experience\\\" had been rolled out to all users.\\n\\n\\n==== 2011-2014 ====\\nOn April 5, 2011, Twitter tested a new homepage and phased out the \\\"Old Twitter\\\". However, a glitch came about after the page was launched, so the previous \\\"retro\\\" homepage was still in use until the issues were resolved; the new homepage was reintroduced on April 20. On December 8, 2011, Twitter overhauled its website once more to feature the \\\"Fly\\\" design, which the service says is easier for new users to follow and promotes advertising. In addition to the Home tab, the Connect and Discover tabs were introduced along with a redesigned profile and timeline of Tweets. The site's layout has been compared to that of Facebook. On February 21, 2012, it was announced that Twitter and Yandex agreed to a partnership. Yandex, a Russian search engine, finds value within the partnership due to Twitter's real time news feeds. Twitter's director of business development explained that it is important to have Twitter content where Twitter users go. On March 21, 2012, Twitter celebrated its sixth birthday while also announcing that it had 140 million users and 340 million tweets per day. The number of users was up 40% from their September 2011 number, which was said to have been at 100 million at the time.In April 2012, Twitter announced that it was opening an office in Detroit, with the aim of working with automotive brands and advertising agencies. Twitter also expanded its office in Dublin. On June 5, 2012, a modified logo was unveiled through the company blog, removing the text to showcase the slightly redesigned bird as the sole symbol of Twitter. On October 5, 2012, Twitter acquired a video clip company called Vine that launched in January 2013. Twitter released Vine as a standalone app that allows users to create and share six-second looping video clips on January 24, 2013. Vine videos shared on Twitter are visible directly in users' Twitter feeds. Due to an influx of inappropriate content, it is now rated 17+ in Apple's app store. On December 18, 2012, Twitter announced it had surpassed 200 million monthly active users. Twitter hit 100 million monthly active users in September 2011.On January 28, 2013, Twitter acquired Crashlytics in order to build out its mobile developer products.On April 18, 2013, Twitter launched a music app called Twitter Music for the iPhone. On August 28, 2013, Twitter acquired Trendrr, followed by the acquisition of MoPub on September 9, 2013. As of September 2013, the company's data showed that 200 million users send over 400 million tweets daily, with nearly 60% of tweets sent from mobile devices. On June 4, 2014, Twitter announced that it will acquire Namo Media, a technology firm specializing in \\\"native advertising\\\" for mobile devices. On June 19, 2014, Twitter announced that it has reached an undisclosed deal to buy SnappyTV, a service that helps edit and share video from television broadcasts. The company was helping broadcasters and rights holders to share video content both organically across social and via Twitter's Amplify program. In July 2014, Twitter announced that it intends to buy a young company called CardSpring for an undisclosed sum. CardSpring enables retailers to offer online shoppers coupons that they can automatically sync to their credit cards in order to receive discounts when they shop in physical stores. On July 31, 2014, Twitter announced that it has acquired a small password-security startup called Mitro. On October 29, 2014, Twitter announced a new partnership with IBM. The partnership is intended to help businesses use Twitter data to understand their customers, businesses and other trends.\\n\\n\\n==== 2015 and slow growth ====\\nOn February 11, 2015, Twitter announced that it had acquired Niche, an advertising network for social media stars, founded by Rob Fishman and Darren Lachtman. The acquisition price was reportedly $50 million. On March 13, 2015, Twitter announced its acquisition of Periscope, an app that allows live streaming of video. In April 2015, the Twitter.com desktop homepage changed. Twitter announced that it has acquired TellApart, a commerce ads tech firm, with $532 million stock. Later in the year it became apparent that growth had slowed, according to Fortune, Business Insider, Marketing Land and other news websites including Quartz (in 2016). In June 2016, Twitter acquired an artificial intelligence startup called Magic Pony for $150 million.\\n\\n\\n==== Initial public offering (IPO) ====\\n\\nOn September 12, 2013, Twitter announced that it had filed papers with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) ahead of a planned stock market listing. It revealed its prospectus in an 800-page filing. Twitter planned to raise US$1 billion as the basis for its stock market debut. The IPO filing states that \\\"200,000,000+ monthly active users\\\" access Twitter and \\\"500,000,000+ tweets per day\\\" are posted. In an October 15, 2013 amendment to their SEC S-1 filing, Twitter declared that they would list on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), quashing speculation that their stock would trade on the NASDAQ exchange. This decision was widely viewed to be a reaction to the botched initial public offering of Facebook. On November 6, 2013, 70 million shares were priced at US$26 and issued by lead underwriter Goldman Sachs.On November 7, 2013, the first day of trading on the NYSE, Twitter shares opened at $26.00 and closed at US$44.90, giving the company a valuation of around US$31 billion. The paperwork from show of November 7 that among the founders, Williams received a sum of US$2.56 billion and Dorsey received US$1.05 billion, while Costolo's payment was US$345 million. On February 5, 2014, Twitter published its first results as a public company, showing a net loss of $511 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. On January 5, 2016, CEO Jack Dorsey commented on a report that Twitter planned to expand its character limit to 10,000 (private messages already had the longer limit as of July), requiring users to click to see anything beyond 140 characters. He said while Twitter would \\\"never lose that feeling\\\" of speed, users could do more with the text.In September 2016, Twitter shares rose 20% after a report that it had received takeover approaches. Potential buyers were Alphabet (parent company of Google), Microsoft, Salesforce.com, Verizon, and The Walt Disney Company. Twitter's board of directors were open to a deal, which could have come by the end of 2016. However, no deal was made, with reports in October stating that all the potential buyers dropped out partly due to concerns over abuse and harassment on the service. In June 2017, Twitter revamped its dashboard to improve the new user experience.\\n\\n\\n== Leadership ==\\nAs chief executive officer, Dorsey saw the startup through two rounds of capital funding by the venture capitalists who backed the company. On October 16, 2008, Williams took over the role of CEO, and Dorsey became chairman of the board. On October 4, 2010, Williams announced that he was stepping down as CEO. Dick Costolo, formerly Twitter's chief operating officer, became CEO. On October 4, 2010, Williams made an announcement saying that he will stay with the company and \\\"be completely focused on product strategy\\\".According to The New York Times, \\\"Mr. Dorsey and Mr. Costolo forged a close relationship\\\" when Williams was away. According to PC Magazine, Williams was \\\"no longer involved in the day-to-day goings on at the company\\\". He was focused on developing a new startup, and became a member of Twitter's board of directors, and promised to \\\"help in any way I can\\\". In 2011, Stone was still with Twitter but was working with AOL as an \\\"advisor on volunteer efforts and philanthropy\\\". In January 2014 Stone announced the release of Jelly, a 'social Q&A network for mobile'. Dorsey rejoined Twitter in March 2011, as executive chairman focusing on product development. At that time he split his schedule with Square (where he is CEO), whose offices are within walking distance of Twitter's in San Francisco.In September 2011, board members and investors Fred Wilson and Bijan Sabet resigned from Twitter's Board of Directors. In October 2012, Twitter announced it had hired former Google executive Matt Derella to become their new director of business agency development. Twitter named former Goldman Sachs executive Anthony Noto as the company's CFO in July 2014, with an \\\"annual salary of $250,000 and one-time restricted stock options of 1.5 million shares ... valued at $61.5 million\\\". On June 10, 2015, Twitter announced its CEO Dick Costolo would resign on July 1, 2015. Noto was said to be considered a potential replacement for outgoing CEO Costolo. On October 14, 2015, former Google chief business officer Omid Kordestani became executive chairman, replacing Dorsey who remains CEO. On January 26, 2016, Leslie Berland, former executive vice president of global advertising, marketing, and digital partnerships at American Express, was named chief marketing officer. In November 2016, COO Adam Bain announced his resignation and CFO Anthony Noto took over Bain's role. A month later, on December 20, 2016, CTO Adam Messinger announced that he too was leaving.\\n\\n\\n== Appearance and features ==\\n\\n\\n=== Logo ===\\n\\nTwitter has become internationally identifiable by its signature bird logo, or the Twitter Bird. The original logo, which was simply the word \\\"Twitter\\\", was in use from its launch in March 2006 until September 2010. It was accompanied by an image of a bird which was a piece of clip art created by the British graphic designer Simon Oxley. A slightly modified version with \\\"Larry the Bird\\\" next to the old logo succeeded the first style when the website underwent its first redesign. A tweet from an employee that works on the company's platform and API discussed the evolution of the \\\"Larry the Bird\\\" logo with Twitter's creative director and it was revealed that it was named after Larry Bird of the NBA's Boston Celtics fame. This detail had been confirmed when the Boston Celtics' director of interactive media asked Twitter co-founder Biz Stone about it in August 2011. \\nIn 2012, Twitter unveiled its third logo redesign, replacing Larry the Bird with an updated icon simply named as the \\\"Twitter Bird,\\\" as seen to the right. As of this logo revision, the word \\\"Twitter\\\" and the lowercase letter \\\"t\\\" are no longer used, with the bird becoming the sole symbol for the company's branding. According to Douglas Bowman, designer of Twitter, the new logo resembles a mountain bluebird.\\n\\n\\n=== Font ===\\nOn May 30, 2014 Twitter announced, \\\"Starting today, we're rolling out a new font on twitter.com, moving from Helvetica Neue to Gotham\\\".\\n\\n\\n=== Tweets ===\\n\\nTweets are publicly visible by default, but senders can restrict message delivery to just their followers. Users can tweet via the Twitter website, compatible external applications (such as for smartphones), or by Short Message Service (SMS) available in certain countries. Users may subscribe to other users' tweets--this is known as \\\"following\\\" and subscribers are known as \\\"followers\\\" or \\\"tweeps\\\", a portmanteau of Twitter and peeps. Individual tweets can be forwarded by other users to their own feed, a process known as a \\\"retweet\\\". Users can also \\\"like\\\" (formerly \\\"favorite\\\") individual tweets. Twitter allows users to update their profile via their mobile phone either by text messaging or by apps released for certain smartphones and tablets. Twitter has been compared to a web-based Internet Relay Chat (IRC) client. In a 2009 Time essay, technology author Steven Johnson described the basic mechanics of Twitter as \\\"remarkably simple\\\":\\nAs a social network, Twitter revolves around the principle of followers. When you choose to follow another Twitter user, that user's tweets appear in reverse chronological order on your main Twitter page. If you follow 20 people, you'll see a mix of tweets scrolling down the page: breakfast-cereal updates, interesting new links, music recommendations, even musings on the future of education.\\n\\nAccording to research published in April 2014, around 44 percent of user accounts have never tweeted.The first tweet was posted by Jack Dorsey (creator) at 12:50 PM PST on March 21, 2006 and read \\\"just setting up my twttr\\\". In 2009, the first tweet was sent from space. US astronauts Nicola Stott and Jeff Williams took part in a live 'tweetup' from the International Space Station with around 35 members of the public at NASA Headquarters, Washington, DC, USA.\\n\\n\\n==== Content ====\\n\\nSan Antonio-based market-research firm Pear Analytics analyzed 2,000 tweets (originating from the United States and in English) over a two-week period in August 2009 from 11:00 am to 5:00 pm (CST) and separated them into six categories. Pointless babble made up 40%, with 38% being conversational. Pass-along value had 9%, self-promotion 6% with spam and news each making 4%.\\nDespite Jack Dorsey's own open contention that a message on Twitter is \\\"a short burst of inconsequential information\\\", social networking researcher Danah Boyd responded to the Pear Analytics survey by arguing that what the Pear researchers labelled \\\"pointless babble\\\" is better characterized as \\\"social grooming\\\" and/or \\\"peripheral awareness\\\" (which she justifies as persons \\\"want[ing] to know what the people around them are thinking and doing and feeling, even when co-presence isn't viable\\\"). Similarly, a survey of Twitter users found that a more specific social role of passing along messages that include a hyperlink is an expectation of reciprocal linking by followers.\\n\\n\\n==== Format ====\\n\\nUsers can group posts together by topic or type by use of hashtags - words or phrases prefixed with a \\\"#\\\" sign. Similarly, the \\\"@\\\" sign followed by a username is used for mentioning or replying to other users.\\nTo repost a message from another Twitter user and share it with one's own followers, a user can click the retweet button within the Tweet.\\nIn late 2009, the \\\"Twitter Lists\\\" feature was added, making it possible for users to follow ad hoc lists of authors instead of individual authors.Through SMS, users can communicate with Twitter through five gateway numbers: short codes for the United States, Canada, India, New Zealand, and an Isle of Man-based number for international use. There is also a short code in the United Kingdom which is only accessible to those on the Vodafone, O2 and Orange networks. In India, since Twitter only supports tweets from Bharti Airtel, an alternative platform called smsTweet was set up by a user to work on all networks. A similar platform called GladlyCast exists for mobile phone users in Singapore and Malaysia.The tweets were set to a largely constrictive 140-character limit for compatibility with SMS messaging, introducing the shorthand notation and slang commonly used in SMS messages. The 140-character limit also increased the usage of URL shortening services such as bit.ly, goo.gl, tinyurl.com, tr.im, and other content-hosting services such as TwitPic, memozu.com and NotePub to accommodate multimedia content and text longer than 140 characters. Since June 2011, Twitter has used its own t.co domain for automatic shortening of all URLs posted on its site, making other link shorteners unnecessary for staying within Twitter's 140 character limit.In 2016, Twitter announced that media such as photos, videos, and the person's handle, would not count against the already constrictive 140 character limit. A user photo post used to count for a large chunk of a Tweet, about 24 characters. Attachments and links would also no longer be part of the character limit. In 2017, Twitter increased to 280-character limit tweets. Under the new limit, glyphs are counted as a variable number of characters, depending upon the script they are from: most European letters and punctuation forms count as one character, while each CJK glyph counts as two, so that only 140 such glyphs can be used in a tweet.\\n\\n\\n==== Trending topics ====\\n\\nA word, phrase, or topic that is mentioned at a greater rate than others is said to be a \\\"trending topic\\\". Trending topics become popular either through a concerted effort by users or because of an event that prompts people to talk about a specific topic. These topics help Twitter and their users to understand what is happening in the world and what people's opinions are about it.Trending topics are sometimes the result of concerted efforts and manipulations by preteen and teenaged fans of certain celebrities or cultural phenomena, particularly musicians like Lady Gaga (known as Little Monsters), Justin Bieber (Beliebers), Rihanna (Rih Navy) and One Direction (Directioners), and novel series Twilight (Twihards) and Harry Potter (Potterheads). Twitter has altered the trend algorithm in the past to prevent manipulation of this type with limited success.The Twitter web interface displays a list of trending topics on a sidebar on the home page, along with sponsored content (see image).\\nTwitter often censors trending hashtags that are claimed to be abusive or offensive. Twitter censored the #Thatsafrican and #thingsdarkiessay hashtags after users complained that they found the hashtags offensive. There are allegations that Twitter removed #NaMOinHyd from the trending list and added an Indian National Congress-sponsored hashtag.\\n\\n\\n=== Adding and following content ===\\nThere are numerous tools for adding content, monitoring content and conversations including Twitter's own TweetDeck, Salesforce.com, HootSuite, and Twitterfeed.com. As of  2009, fewer than half of tweets posted were posted using the web user interface with most users using third-party applications (based on an analysis of 500 million tweets by Sysomos).\\n\\n\\n=== Verified accounts ===\\n\\nIn June 2009, after being criticized by Kanye West and sued by Tony La Russa over unauthorized accounts run by impersonators, Twitter launched their 'Verified Accounts' program. Twitter stated that an account with a verification badge indicates \\\"we've been in contact with the person or entity the account is representing and verified that it is approved.\\\" After the beta period, Twitter stated in their FAQ that the company \\\"proactively verifies accounts on an ongoing basis to make it easier for users to find who they're looking for\\\" and that they \\\"do not accept requests for verification from the general public.\\\"In July 2016, Twitter announced a public application process to grant verified status to an account \\\"if it is determined to be of public interest\\\" and that verification \\\"does not imply an endorsement.\\\" As of November 2017, Twitter continued to deny verification of Julian Assange despite his requests. In November 2017, the company suspended the verification process and announced plans to refine it in response to backlash after white nationalist Jason Kessler had his account verified on Twitter.Verified status allows access to some features unavailable to other users, such as only seeing mentions from other verified accounts.In a March 8, 2018 live-stream on Twitter's Periscope, Dorsey discussed the idea of allowing any user to get a verified account. \\\"The intention is to open verification to everyone, and to do it in a way that is scalable where [Twitter is] not in the way,\\\" Dorsey said. \\\"And people can verify more facts about themselves, and we don't have to be the judge or imply any bias on our part.\\\"\\n\\n\\n=== Mobile ===\\n\\nTwitter has mobile apps for iPhone, iPad, Android, Windows 10, Windows Phone, BlackBerry, and Nokia S40. Users can also tweet by sending SMS. In April 2017, Twitter introduced Twitter Lite, a progressive web app designed for regions with unreliable and slow Internet connections, with a size of less than one megabyte, designed for devices with limited storage capacity.This has been released in countries with slow internet connection such as the Philippines.\\n\\n\\n=== Third-party applications ===\\nFor many years, Twitter has limited the use of third-party applications accessing the service by implementing a 100,000 user limit per application. Since August 2010, third-party Twitter applications have been required to use OAuth, an authentication method that does not require users to enter their password into the authenticating application. This was done to increase security and improve the user experience.\\n\\n\\n=== Related headlines feature ===\\nThis feature adds websites to the bottom of a tweet's permalink page. If a website embedded a tweet onto one of their stories, the tweet will show the websites that mentioned the tweet. This feature was added onto Twitter so if the viewer doesn't understand what the tweet means, they can click on the sites to read more about what the person is talking about.\\n\\n\\n=== Polls ===\\nIn 2015, Twitter began to roll out the ability to attach poll questions to tweets. Polls are open for up to 7 days, and voters are not personally identified.\\n\\n\\n=== Streaming video ===\\nIn 2016, Twitter began to place a larger focus on live streaming video programming, hosting various events including streams of the Republican and Democratic conventions during the U.S. presidential campaign as part of a partnership with CBS News, Dreamhack and ESL eSports events, and winning a bid for non-exclusive streaming rights to ten NFL Thursday Night Football games in the 2016 season.During an event in New York in May 2017, Twitter announced that it planned to construct a 24-hour streaming video channel hosted within the service, featuring content from various partners. CEO Jack Dorsey stated that the digital video strategy was part of a goal for Twitter to be \\\"the first place that anyone hears of anything going on that matters to them\\\"; as of the first quarter of 2017, Twitter had over 200 content partners, who streamed over 800 hours of video over 450 events.Twitter announced a number of new and expanded partnerships for its streaming video services at the event, including Bloomberg, BuzzFeed, Cheddar (Opening Bell and Closing Bell shows; the latter was introduced in October 2016) IMG Fashion (coverage of fashion events), Live Nation Entertainment (streaming concert events), Major League Baseball (weekly online game stream, plus a weekly program with live look-ins and coverage of trending stories), MTV and BET (red carpet coverage for their MTV Video Music Awards, MTV Movie & TV Awards, and BET Awards), NFL Network (the Monday-Thursday news program NFL Blitz Live, and Sunday Fantasy Gameday), the PGA Tour (PGA Tour Live coverage of early tournament rounds preceding television coverage), The Players' Tribune, Ben Silverman and Howard T. Owens' Propagate (daily entertainment show #WhatsHappening), The Verge (weekly technology show Circuit Breaker: The Verge's Gadget Show), Stadium (a new digital sports network being formed by Silver Chalice and Sinclair Broadcast Group) and the WNBA (weekly game).\\n\\n\\n== Usage ==\\nIn March 2018, Twitter is ranked the twelfth most visited website by Alexa's web traffic analysis. Daily user estimates vary as the company does not publish statistics on active accounts. A February 2009 Compete.com blog entry ranked Twitter as the third most used social network based on their count of 6 million unique monthly visitors and 55 million monthly visits. In 2009, Twitter had a monthly user retention rate of forty percent. Twitter had annual growth of 1,382 percent, increasing from 475,000 unique visitors in February 2008 to 7 million in February 2009. Twitter's annual growth rate decreased from 7.8 percent in 2015 to 3.4 percent in 2017. An April 2017 a statista.com blog entry ranked Twitter as the tenth most used social network based on their count of 319 million monthly visitors. Its global user base in 2017 was 328 million. As per August 2018, Twitter light (data saving app) is available in 45 countries.\\n\\n\\n=== Demographics ===\\n\\nIn 2009, Twitter was mainly used by older adults who might not have used other social sites before Twitter, said Jeremiah Owyang, an industry analyst studying social media. \\\"Adults are just catching up to what teens have been doing for years,\\\" he said. According to comScore only eleven percent of Twitter's users are aged twelve to seventeen. comScore attributed this to Twitter's \\\"early adopter period\\\" when the social network first gained popularity in business settings and news outlets attracting primarily older users. However, comScore also stated in 2009 that Twitter had begun to \\\"filter more into the mainstream\\\", and \\\"along with it came a culture of celebrity as Shaq, Britney Spears and Ashton Kutcher joined the ranks of the Twitterati\\\".According to a study by Sysomos in June 2009, women make up a slightly larger Twitter demographic than men--fifty-three percent over forty-seven percent. It also stated that five percent of users accounted for seventy-five percent of all activity, and that New York City has more Twitter users than other cities.According to Quancast, twenty-seven million people in the US used Twitter as of September 3, 2009. Sixty-three percent of Twitter users are under thirty-five years old; sixty percent of Twitter users are Caucasian, but a higher than average (compared to other Internet properties) are African American/black (sixteen percent) and Hispanic (eleven percent); fifty-eight percent of Twitter users have a total household income of at least US$60,000. The prevalence of African American Twitter usage and in many popular hashtags has been the subject of research studies.On September 7, 2011, Twitter announced that it had 100 million active users logging in at least once a month and 50 million active users every day.In an article published on January 6, 2012, Twitter was confirmed to be the biggest social media network in Japan, with Facebook following closely in second. comScore confirmed this, stating that Japan was the only country in the world where Twitter leads Facebook.On March 31, 2014, Twitter announced there were 255 million monthly active users (MAUs) and 198 million mobile MAUs. In 2013, there were over 100 million users actively using Twitter daily and about 500 million Tweets every day, with about 29% of users checking Twitter multiple times a day.In 2012, the country with the most active users on Twitter was the United States. A 2016 Pew research poll found that Twitter is used by 24% of all online US adults. It was equally popular with men and women (24% and 25% of online Americans respectively), but more popular with younger (36% of 18-29 year olds) generations.\\n\\n\\n== Finances ==\\n\\n\\n=== Funding ===\\n\\nTwitter raised over US$57 million from venture capitalist growth funding, although exact figures are not publicly disclosed. Twitter's first A round of funding was for an undisclosed amount that is rumored to have been between US$1 million and US$5 million. Its second B round of funding in 2008 was for US$22 million and its third C round of funding in 2009 was for US$35 million from Institutional Venture Partners and Benchmark Capital along with an undisclosed amount from other investors including Union Square Ventures, Spark Capital, and Insight Venture Partners. Twitter is backed by Union Square Ventures, Digital Garage, Spark Capital, and Bezos Expeditions.In May 2008, The Industry Standard remarked that Twitter's long-term viability is limited by a lack of revenue. Twitter board member Todd Chaffee forecast that the company could profit from e-commerce, noting that users may want to buy items directly from Twitter since it already provides product recommendations and promotions.By March 2009 communications consultant Bill Douglass predicted in an interview that Twitter would be worth $1 billion within six months, which came to pass when the company closed a financing round valuing it at $1 billion in September of that year.The company raised US$200 million in new venture capital in December 2010, at a valuation of approximately US$3.7 billion. In March 2011, 35,000 Twitter shares sold for US$34.50 each on Sharespost, an implied valuation of US$7.8 billion. In August 2010 Twitter announced a \\\"significant\\\" investment led by Digital Sky Technologies that, at US$800 million, was reported to be the largest venture round in history.In December 2011, the Saudi prince Alwaleed bin Talal invested US$300 million in Twitter. The company was valued at US$8.4 billion at the time. In 2016, Twitter was valued by Forbes at US$15.7 billion.\\n\\n\\n=== Revenue sources ===\\nIn July 2009, some of Twitter's revenue and user growth documents were published on TechCrunch after being illegally obtained by Hacker Croll. The documents projected 2009 revenues of US$400,000 in the third quarter and US$4 million in the fourth quarter along with 25 million users by the end of the year. The projections for the end of 2013 were US$1.54 billion in revenue, US$111 million in net earnings, and one billion users. No information about how Twitter planned to achieve those numbers was published. In response, Twitter co-founder Biz Stone published a blog post suggesting the possibility of legal action against the hacker.On April 13, 2010, Twitter announced plans to offer paid advertising for companies that would be able to purchase \\\"promoted tweets\\\" to appear in selective search results on the Twitter website, similar to Google Adwords' advertising model. As of April 13, Twitter announced it had already signed up a number of companies wishing to advertise, including Sony Pictures, Red Bull, Best Buy, and Starbucks.The company generated US$45 million in annual revenue in 2010, after beginning sales midway through that year; the company operated at a loss through most of 2010.Users' photos can generate royalty-free revenue for Twitter, and an agreement with World Entertainment News Network (WENN) was announced in May 2011. In June 2011, Twitter announced that it would offer small businesses a self-service advertising system. Twitter generated US$139.5 million in advertising sales during 2011.\\nThe self-service advertising platform was launched in March 2012 to American Express card members and merchants in the U.S. on an invite-only basis. Twitter later reported that numerous small businesses and people who used the self-service tool provided feedback that indicated they were impressed by the feature. To continue their advertising campaign, Twitter announced on March 20, 2012, that promoted tweets would be introduced to mobile devices. In April 2013, Twitter announced that its Twitter Ads self-service platform, consisting of promoted tweets and promoted accounts, was available to all U.S. users without an invite.Twitter's financial revenue statistics for the first quarter of 2014 was reported as US$250 million.On August 3, 2016, Twitter launched Instant Unlock Card, a new feature that encourages people to tweet about a brand in order to earn rewards and utilize the social media network's conversational ads. The format itself consists of images or videos with call-to-action buttons and a customizable hashtag.\\n\\n\\n== Technology ==\\n\\n\\n=== Implementation ===\\nTwitter places great reliance on open-source software. The Twitter Web interface uses the Ruby on Rails framework, deployed on a performance enhanced Ruby Enterprise Edition implementation of Ruby.In the early days of Twitter, tweets were stored in MySQL databases that were temporally sharded (large databases were split based on time of posting). After the huge volume of tweets coming in caused problems reading from and writing to these databases, the company decided that the system needed re-engineering.As of April 6, 2011, Twitter engineers confirmed that they had switched away from their Ruby on Rails search stack to a Java server they call Blender.From Spring 2007 to 2008, the messages were handled by a Ruby persistent queue server called Starling.  Since 2009, implementation has been gradually replaced with software written in Scala. The switch from Ruby to Scala and the JVM has given Twitter a performance boost from 200-300 requests per second per host to around 10,000-20,000 requests per second per host. This boost was greater than the 10x improvement that Twitter's engineers envisioned when starting the switch. The continued development of Twitter has also involved a switch from monolithic development of a single app to an architecture where different services are built independently and joined through remote procedure calls.Individual tweets are registered under unique IDs using software called snowflake, and geolocation data is added using 'Rockdove'. The URL shortner t.co then checks for a spam link and shortens the URL. Next, the tweets are stored in a MySQL database using Gizzard, and the user receives acknowledgement that the tweets were sent. Tweets are then sent to search engines via the Firehose API. The process is managed by FlockDB and takes an average of 350 ms.On August 16, 2013, Raffi Krikorian, Twitter's Vice President of Platform Engineering, shared in a blog post that the company's infrastructure handled almost 143,000 tweets per second during that week, setting a new record. Krikorian explained that Twitter achieved this record by blending its homegrown and open source technologies.The service's application programming interface (API) allows other web services and applications to integrate with Twitter.\\n\\n\\n=== Interface ===\\nOn April 30, 2009, Twitter adjusted its Web interface, adding a search bar and a sidebar of \\\"trending topics\\\"--the most common phrases appearing in messages. Biz Stone explains that all messages are instantly indexed and that \\\"with this newly launched feature, Twitter has become something unexpectedly important - a discovery engine for finding out what is happening right now.\\\"In March 2012, Twitter became available in Arabic, Farsi, Hebrew and Urdu, the first right-to-left language versions of the site. About 13,000 volunteers helped with translating the menu options. In August 2012, beta support for Basque, Czech and Greek was added, making the site available in 33 different languages.\\n\\n\\n=== Outages ===\\n\\nWhen Twitter experiences an outage, users once saw the \\\"fail whale\\\" error message image created by Yiying Lu, illustrating eight orange birds using a net to hoist a whale from the ocean captioned \\\"Too many tweets! Please wait a moment and try again.\\\" In a November 2013 WIRED interview Chris Fry, VP of Engineering at that time, noted that the company had taken the \\\"fail whale\\\" out of production as the platform was now more stable.Twitter had approximately ninety-eight percent uptime in 2007 (or about six full days of downtime). The downtime was particularly noticeable during events popular with the technology industry such as the 2008 Macworld Conference & Expo keynote address.\\n\\n\\n=== Privacy, security, and harassment ===\\nTwitter messages are public, but users can also send private messages. Information about who has chosen to follow an account and who a user has chosen to follow is also public, though accounts can be changed to \\\"protected\\\" which limits this information (and all tweets) to approved followers. Twitter collects personally identifiable information about its users and shares it with third parties as specified in its privacy policy. The service also reserves the right to sell this information as an asset if the company changes hands. While Twitter displays no advertising, advertisers can target users based on their history of tweets and may quote tweets in ads directed specifically to the user.\\nA security vulnerability was reported on April 7, 2007, by Nitesh Dhanjani and Rujith. Since Twitter used the phone number of the sender of an SMS message as authentication, malicious users could update someone else's status page by using SMS spoofing. The vulnerability could be used if the spoofer knew the phone number registered to their victim's account. Within a few weeks of this discovery, Twitter introduced an optional personal identification number (PIN) that its users could use to authenticate their SMS-originating messages.On January 5, 2009, 33 high-profile Twitter accounts were compromised after a Twitter administrator's password was guessed by a dictionary attack. Falsified tweets--including sexually explicit and drug-related messages--were sent from these accounts.Twitter launched the beta version of their \\\"Verified Accounts\\\" service on June 11, 2009, allowing famous or notable people to announce their account name. The home pages of these accounts display a badge indicating their status.In May 2010, a bug was discovered by Inci Sozluk that could allow a Twitter user to force others to follow them without the other users' consent or knowledge. For example, comedian Conan O'Brien's account, which had been set to follow only one person, was changed to receive nearly 200 malicious subscriptions.In response to Twitter's security breaches, the United States Federal Trade Commission (FTC) brought charges against the service; the charges were settled on June 24, 2010. This was the first time the FTC had taken action against a social network for security lapses. The settlement requires Twitter to take a number of steps to secure users' private information, including maintenance of a \\\"comprehensive information security program\\\" to be independently audited biannually.On December 14, 2010, the United States Department of Justice issued a subpoena directing Twitter to provide information for accounts registered to or associated with WikiLeaks. Twitter decided to notify its users and said in a statement, \\\"... it's our policy to notify users about law enforcement and governmental requests for their information, unless we are prevented by law from doing so.\\\"A \\\"MouseOver\\\" exploit occurred on September 21, 2010, when an XSS Worm became active on Twitter. When a user held the mouse cursor over blacked-out parts of a tweet, the worm within the script would automatically open links and re-post itself on the reader's account. The exploit was then re-used to post pop-up ads and links to pornographic sites. The origin of the worm is unclear, but Pearce H. Delphin (known on Twitter as @zzap) and a Scandinavian developer, Magnus Holm, both claim to have modified a related exploit found by another user (possibly Masato Kinugawa) who was using it to create coloured Tweets. Kinugawa, a Japanese developer, reported the XSS vulnerability to Twitter on August 14. Later, when he found it was exploitable again, he created the account 'RainbowTwtr' and used it to post coloured messages. Delphin says he exposed the security flaw by tweeting a JavaScript function for \\\"onMouseOver\\\", and Holm later created and posted the XSS Worm that automatically re-tweeted itself. Security firm Sophos reported that the virus was spread by people doing it for \\\"fun and games\\\", but noted it could be exploited by cybercriminals. Twitter issued a statement on their status blog at 13:50 UTC that \\\"The exploit is fully patched.\\\" Twitter representative Carolyn Penner said no charges would be pressed.In May 2011, a claimant known as \\\"CTB\\\" in the case of CTB v Twitter Inc., Persons Unknown took action against Twitter at the High Court of Justice of England and Wales, requesting that the company release details of account holders. This followed gossip posted on Twitter about Giggs's private life. This led to the 2011 British privacy injunctions controversy and the \\\"super-injunction\\\". Tony Wang, the head of Twitter in Europe, said that people who do \\\"bad things\\\" on the site would need to defend themselves under the laws of their own jurisdiction in the event of controversy, and that the site would hand over information about users to the authorities when it was legally required to do so. He also suggested that Twitter would accede to a UK court order to divulge names of users responsible for \\\"illegal activity\\\" on the site.Twitter would be acquired Dasient, a startup that offers malware protection for businesses, in January 2012. Twitter announced plans to use Dasient to help remove hateful advertisers on the website. Twitter also offered a feature which would allow tweets to be removed selectively by country, before deleted tweets used to be removed in all countries. The first use of the policy was to block the account of German neo-Nazi group Besseres Hannover on October 18, 2012. The policy was used again the following day to remove anti-Semitic French tweets with the hashtag #unbonjuif (\\\"a good Jew\\\"). In February 2012, a third-party public-key encryption app (written in Python and partially funded by a grant from the Shuttleworth Foundation) for private messaging in Twitter, CrypTweet, was released. A month later Twitter announced it would implement the \\\"Do Not Track\\\" privacy option, a cookie-blocking feature found in Mozilla's Firefox browser. The \\\"Do Not Track\\\" feature works only on sites that have agreed to the service.In August 2012, it was reported that there is a market in fake Twitter followers that are used to increase politicians' and celebrities' apparent popularity. The black market for the fake followers, known as \\\"bots\\\", has been linked to \\\"nearly every politically linked account from the White House to Congress to the 2016 campaign trail\\\". In June 2014, POLITICO analyzed Twitter handles with the highest rates of fake followers: US President Barack Obama with 46.8 percent, Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz with 35.1 percent, and Senator John McCain with 23.6 percent. The culprits working to generate the fake followers, or \\\"bots\\\", include campaign workers or friends of political candidates. One site offers 1,000 fake followers for $20. The people creating the \\\"bots\\\" are often from Eastern Europe and Asia. In 2013, two Italian researchers calculated 10 percent of total accounts on Twitter are \\\"bots\\\" however, other estimates have placed the figure even higher.After a number of high-profile hacks of official accounts, including those of the Associated Press and The Guardian, in April 2013, Twitter announced a two-factor login verification as an added measure against hacking. In August Twitter announced plans to introduce a \\\"report abuse\\\" button for all versions of the site following uproar, including a petition with 100,000 signatures, over Tweets that included rape and death threats to historian Mary Beard, feminist campaigner Caroline Criado Perez and the member of parliament Stella Creasy. Followed the sharing of images showing the killing of American journalist James Foley in 2014, Twitter said that in certain cases it would delete pictures of people who had died after requests from family members and \\\"authorized individuals\\\".Twitter announced new reporting and blocking policies in December 2014, including a blocking mechanism devised by Randi Harper, a target of GamerGate. In February 2015, CEO Dick Costolo said he was 'frankly ashamed' at how poorly Twitter handled trolling and abuse, and admitted Twitter had lost users as a result.In 2015, following an updated terms of service and privacy policy, Twitter users outside of the United States are legally served by the Ireland-based Twitter International Company instead of Twitter, Inc. The change made these users subject to Irish and European Union data protection lawsIn 2016, Twitter announced the creation of the Twitter Trust & Safety Council to help \\\"ensure that people feel safe expressing themselves on Twitter.\\\" The council's inaugural members included 50 organizations and individuals.On May 5, 2018, Twitter sent out an update/mail to every customer regarding a bug that stored passwords unmasked in an internal log. According to them the investigation showed no indications of breach or misuse but recommended everyone to change their password anyway.\\n\\n\\n=== Open source ===\\nTwitter has a history of both using and releasing open source software while overcoming technical challenges of their service. A page in their developer documentation thanks dozens of open source projects which they have used, from revision control software like Git to programming languages such as Ruby and Scala. Software released as open source by the company includes the Gizzard Scala framework for creating distributed datastores, the distributed graph database FlockDB, the Finagle library for building asynchronous RPC servers and clients, the TwUI user interface framework for iOS, and the Bower client-side package manager. The popular Twitter Bootstrap web design library was also started at Twitter and is the second most popular repository on GitHub.\\n\\n\\n=== Innovators patent agreement ===\\nOn April 17, 2012, Twitter announced it would implement an \\\"Innovators Patent Agreement\\\" which would obligate Twitter to only use its patents for defensive purposes. The agreement went into effect in 2012.\\n\\n\\n=== URL shortener ===\\nt.co is a URL shortening service created by Twitter. It is only available for links posted to Twitter and not available for general use. All links posted to Twitter use a t.co wrapper. Twitter hopes that the service will be able to protect users from malicious sites, and will use it to track clicks on links within tweets.Having used the services of third parties TinyURL and bit.ly, Twitter began experimenting with its own URL shortening service for private messages in March 2010 using the twt.tl domain, before it purchased the t.co domain. The service was tested on the main site using the accounts @TwitterAPI, @rsarver and @raffi. On September 2, 2010, an email from Twitter to users said they would be expanding the roll-out of the service to users. On June 7, 2011, Twitter announced that it was rolling out the feature.\\n\\n\\n=== Integrated photo-sharing service ===\\nOn June 1, 2011, Twitter announced its own integrated photo-sharing service that enables users to upload a photo and attach it to a Tweet right from Twitter.com. Users now also have the ability to add pictures to Twitter's search by adding hashtags to the tweet. Twitter also plans to provide photo galleries designed to gather and syndicate all photos that a user has uploaded on Twitter and third-party services such as TwitPic.\\n\\n\\n=== Twitterbots ===\\nA Twitterbot is a computer program that automatically posts on Twitter, they are programmed to tweet, retweet, and follow other accounts. According to a recent report, there were 20 million, fewer than 5%, of accounts on Twitter that were fraudulent in 2013. These fake accounts are often used to build large follower populations quickly for advertisers, while others respond to tweets that include a certain word or phrase. Twitter's wide-open application programming interface and cloud servers make it possible for twitterbots' existence within the social networking site.\\n\\n\\n== Developers ==\\nTwitter is recognized for having one of the most open and powerful developer APIs of any major technology company. Developer interest in Twitter began immediately following its launch, prompting the company to release the first version of its public API in September 2006. The API quickly became iconic as a reference implementation for public REST APIs and is widely cited in programming tutorials.From 2006 until 2010, Twitter's developer platform experienced strong growth and a highly favorable reputation. Developers built upon the public API to create the first Twitter mobile phone clients as well as the first URL shortener. Between 2010 and 2012, however, Twitter made a number of decisions that were received unfavorably by the developer community. In 2010, Twitter mandated that all developers adopt OAuth authentication with just 9 weeks of notice. Later that year, Twitter launched its own URL shortener, in direct competition with some of its most well-known 3rd-party developers. And in 2012, Twitter introduced strict usage limits for its API, \\\"completely crippling\\\" some developers. While these moves successfully increased the stability and security of the service, they were broadly perceived as hostile to developers, causing them to lose trust in the platform.In an effort to reset its relationship with developers, Twitter acquired Crashlytics on January 28, 2013 for over USD $100 million, its largest acquisition to date. Founded by Jeff Seibert and Wayne Chang, Crashlytics had rapidly gained popularity as a tool to help mobile developers identify and fix bugs in their apps. Twitter committed to continue supporting and expanding the service.In October 2014, Twitter announced Fabric, a suite of mobile developer tools built around Crashlytics. Fabric brought together Crashlytics, Answers (mobile app analytics), Beta (mobile app distribution), Digits (mobile app identity and authentication services), MoPub, and TwitterKit (login with Twitter and Tweet display functionality) into a single, modular SDK, allowing developers to pick and choose which features they needed while guaranteeing ease of installation and compatibility. By building Fabric on top of Crashlytics, Twitter was able to take advantage of Crashlytics' large adoption and device footprint to rapidly scale usage of MoPub and TwitterKit. Fabric reached active distribution across 1 billion mobile devices just 8 months after its launch.In early 2016, Twitter announced that Fabric was installed on more than 2 billion active devices and used by more than 225,000 developers. Fabric is recognized as the #1 most popular crash reporting and also the #1 mobile analytics solution among the top 200 iOS apps, beating out Google Analytics, Flurry, and MixPanel.\\n\\n\\n== Society ==\\n\\n\\n=== Issues and controversies ===\\n\\nTwitter has been used for a variety of purposes in many industries and scenarios. For example, it has been used to organize protests, sometimes referred to as \\\"Twitter Revolutions\\\", which include April 2009 Moldovan parliamentary election protests, 2009 student protests in Austria, 2009 Gaza-Israel conflict, 2009 Iran green revolution, 2009 Toronto G20, 2010 Bolivarian Revolution, 2010 Germany Stuttgart21, 2011 Egypt Revolution, 2011 England riots, 2011 United States Occupy movement, 2011 Anti-austerity movement in Spain, 2011 Greece Aganaktismenoi movements, 2011 Italy Rome demonstration, 2011 Wisconsin labor protests, 2012 Gaza-Israel conflict, 2013 protests in Brazil, 2013 Gezi Park protests. A result of the Iranian election protests saw the government of Iran block Twitter in censorship.The service is also used as a form of civil disobedience: In 2010, users expressed outrage over the Twitter Joke Trial by copying a controversial joke about bombing an airport and attaching the hashtag #IAmSpartacus, a reference to the Spartacus film and a sign of solidarity and support to a man controversially prosecuted after posting a tweet joking about bombing an airport if they cancelled his flight. #IAmSpartacus became the number one trending topic on Twitter worldwide. Another case of civil disobedience happened in the 2011 British privacy injunction debate, where several celebrities who had taken out anonymized injunctions were identified by thousands of users in protest to traditional journalism being censored.During the Arab Spring in early 2011, the number of hashtags mentioning the uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt increased. A study by the Dubai School of Government found that only 0.26% of the Egyptian population, 0.1% of the Tunisian population and 0.04% of the Syrian population are active on Twitter.In January 2016, Twitter was sued by the widow of a U.S. man killed in the 2015 Amman shooting attack, claiming that allowing the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) to continually use the platform, including direct messages in particular, constituted the provision of material support to a terrorist organization, which is illegal under U.S. federal law. Twitter disputed the claim, stating that \\\"violent threats and the promotion of terrorism deserve no place on Twitter and, like other social networks, our rules make that clear.\\\" The lawsuit was dismissed by the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, upholding the Section 230 safe harbor, which dictates that the operators of an interactive computer service are not liable for the content published by its users. The lawsuit was revised in August 2016, providing comparisons to other telecommunications devices.Twitter suspended multiple parody accounts that satirized Russian politics in May 2016, sparking protests and raising questions about where the company stands on freedom of speech. Following public outcry, Twitter restored the accounts the next day without explaining why the accounts had been suspended. The same day, Twitter, along with Facebook, Google, and Microsoft, jointly agreed to a European Union code of conduct obligating them to review \\\"[the] majority of valid notifications for removal of illegal hate speech\\\" posted on their services within 24 hours. In August 2016, Twitter stated that it had banned 235,000 accounts over the past six months, bringing the overall number of suspended accounts to 360,000 accounts in the past year, for violating policies banning use of the platform to promote extremism.In October 2017, actress Rose McGowan said that Twitter had suspended her account for 12 hours after she repeatedly tweeted about former film studio executive Harvey Weinstein's alleged sexual misconduct toward her and others. Twitter explained that McGowan's account had violated its privacy policy because one of her tweets included a private phone number. According to The New York Times, \\\"Many Twitter users expressed outrage over Ms. McGowan's account being locked\\\". After the tweet was removed, her account was unlocked several hours before the 12-hour ban was set to expire. A Twitter representative stated, \\\"We will be clearer about these policies and decisions in the future.\\\" Later that day, software engineer Kelly Ellis, using the hashtag #WomenBoycottTwitter, urged women to shun Twitter for 24 hours, beginning at midnight, in solidarity with McGowan and, tweeted Ellis, \\\"all the victims of hate and harassment Twitter fails to support.\\\" The boycott was joined by activists, celebrities and journalists.In November 2017, the Paradise Papers, a set of confidential electronic documents relating to offshore investment, revealed that Twitter is among the corporations that avoided paying taxes using offshore companies. Later The New York Times reported that Russian-American billionaire Yuri Milner had strong Kremlin backing for his investments in Facebook and Twitter.In May 2018, in response to scrutiny over the misuse of Twitter by those seeking to maliciously influence elections, Twitter announced that it would partner with the nonprofit organization Ballotpedia to add special labels verifying the authenticity of political candidates running for election in the U.S.\\n\\n\\n=== Censorship ===\\n\\nTwitter is banned completely in Iran, China and North Korea, and has been intermittently blocked in numerous countries including Egypt, Iraq, Turkey and Venezuela on different bases. In 2016, Twitter cooperated with the Israeli government to remove certain content originating outside Israel from tweets seen in Israel. In the 11th biannual transparency report published on September 19, 2017, Twitter said that Turkey was the first among countries where about 90 percent of removal requests came from, followed by Russia, France and Germany. As part of evidence to a US Senate Enquiry, the company admitted that their systems \\\"detected and hid\\\" several hundred thousand tweets relating to the 2016 Democratic National Committee email leak.\\n\\n\\n==== Trending topics ====\\nAfter claims in the media that the hashtags #wikileaks and #occupywallstreet were being censored because they did not show up on the site's list of trending topics, Twitter responded by stating that it does not censor hashtags unless they contain obscenities.In 2016, at the same time as Twitter executives paid to attend a political fundraiser by Hillary Clinton, the Twitter platform banned a pro-Bernie Sanders account that had started a hashtag critical of Clinton's fundraising from wealthy donors.\\n\\n\\n==== Trust & Safety Council ====\\nThe announcement of Twitter's \\\"Trust & Safety Council\\\" was met with objection from parts of its userbase. Critics accused the member organizations of being heavily skewed towards \\\"the restriction of hate speech\\\" and a Reason article expressed concern that \\\"there's not a single uncompromising anti-censorship figure or group on the list\\\".\\n\\n\\n=== Impact ===\\n\\n\\n==== Instant, short, and frequent communication ====\\nIn May 2008, The Wall Street Journal wrote that social networking services such as Twitter \\\"elicit mixed feelings in the technology-savvy people who have been their early adopters. Fans say they are a good way to keep in touch with busy friends. But some users are starting to feel too connected, as they grapple with check-in messages at odd hours, higher cellphone bills and the need to tell acquaintances to stop announcing what they're having for dinner.\\\" The following year, John C. Dvorak described Twitter as \\\"the new CB radio\\\".\\n\\n\\n==== Emergency use ====\\nA practical use for Twitter's real-time functionality is as an effective de facto emergency communication system for breaking news. It was neither intended nor designed for high-performance communication, but the idea that it could be used for emergency communication was not lost on the creators, who knew that the service could have wide-reaching effects early on when the company used it to communicate during earthquakes.Another practical use that is being studied is Twitter's ability to track epidemics and how they spread.In addition, Twitter has acted as a sensor for automatic response to natural disasters such as bush fires.\\n\\n\\n==== Education ====\\nTwitter has been adopted as a communication and learning tool in educational and research settings mostly in colleges and universities. It has been used as a backchannel to promote student interactions, especially in large-lecture courses. Research has found that using Twitter in college courses helps students communicate with each other and faculty, promotes informal learning, allows shy students a forum for increased participation, increases student engagement, and improves overall course grades.Twitter has been an increasingly growing in the field of education, as an effective tool that can be used to encourage learning and idea, or knowledge sharing, in and outside the classroom. By using or creating hashtags, students and educators are able to communicate under specific categories of their choice, to enhance and promote education. A broad example of a hashtag used in education is \\\"edchat\\\", to communicate with other teachers, and people using that hashtag. Once teachers find someone they want to talk to, they can either direct message the person, or narrow down the hashtag to make the topic of the conversation more specific using hashtags for scichat (science), engchat (English), sschat (social studies).In a 2011 study, researchers found that young peoples use of Twitter helped to improve relationships with teachers, encourage interactive learning, and ultimately lead to high grades. In the same study it was found that out of a group of 158 educators, 92% agreed that the reason they use Twitter is because of how user friendly it is, another 86% agreed that they started and continue using Twitter because of how easy it is to learn, and finally, 93% said they use Twitter because it is free. People found that sifting through large amounts of data is challenging, however, with the simple nature of Twitter large amount of information became easily accessible. Much of this simplicity comes from the use of the hashtag, and the intuitive nature of how Twitter as a microblogging site operates. These features help to promote education outside the classroom on a global setting where students and educators are easily able create, connect, and share knowledge. This ultimately promotes growth and learning among students and educators, not just in the class room, but virtually and around the world.\\n\\n\\n==== Public figures ====\\nTech writer Bruce Sterling commented in 2007 that using Twitter for \\\"literate communication\\\" is \\\"about as likely as firing up a CB radio and hearing some guy recite the Iliad\\\". In September 2008, the journalist Clive Thompson mused in a New York Times Magazine editorial that the service had expanded narcissism into \\\"a new, supermetabolic extreme--the ultimate expression of a generation of celebrity-addled youths who believe their every utterance is fascinating and ought to be shared with the world\\\". One of the earliest documented forms of celebrity-related Twitter-like disclosures dates from 1980, when real estate mogul William Desmond Ryan made round-the-clock press releases about his relationship with comedian Phyllis Diller, even revealing what she was making him for dinner on a nightly basis. Conversely, Vancouver Sun columnist Steve Dotto opined that part of Twitter's appeal is the challenge of trying to publish such messages in tight constraints, and Jonathan Zittrain, professor of Internet law at Harvard Law School, said that \\\"the qualities that make Twitter seem inane and half-baked are what makes it so powerful.\\\"The novelist Rick Moody wrote a short story for Electric Literature called \\\"Some Contemporary Characters,\\\" composed entirely of tweets.In 2009, Nielsen Online reported that Twitter had a user-retention rate of forty percent. Many people stop using the service after a month; therefore the site may potentially reach only about ten percent of all Internet users. In 2009, Twitter won the \\\"Breakout of the Year\\\" Webby Award. During a February 2009 discussion on National Public Radio's Weekend Edition, the journalist Daniel Schorr stated that Twitter accounts of events lacked rigorous fact-checking and other editorial improvements. In response, Andy Carvin gave Schorr two examples of breaking news stories that played out on Twitter and said users wanted first-hand accounts and sometimes debunked stories. On November 29, 2009, Twitter was named the Word of the Year by the Global Language Monitor, declaring it \\\"a new form of social interaction\\\". Time magazine acknowledged its growing level of influence in its 2010 Time 100; to determine the influence of people, it used a formula based on famous social networking sites, Twitter and Facebook. The list ranges from Barack Obama and Oprah Winfrey to Lady Gaga and Ashton Kutcher. The U.S. government, seeing social media's role in the 2010 Arab Spring revolts, covertly developed a Cuban alternative to Twitter called ZunZuneo as part of a long-term strategy to \\\"stir unrest\\\". The service was active from 2010 to 2012.During the 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony, in which he appeared at the London Olympic Stadium in person, Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the founder of the World Wide Web, tweeted \\\"This is for everyone\\\", which was instantly spelled out in LCD lights attached to the chairs of the 80,000 people in the audience.\\n\\n\\n==== World leaders ====\\nWorld leaders and their diplomats have taken note of Twitter's rapid expansion and have been increasingly utilizing Twitter diplomacy, the use of Twitter to engage with foreign publics and their own citizens. US Ambassador to Russia, Michael A. McFaul has been attributed as a pioneer of international Twitter diplomacy. He used Twitter after becoming ambassador in 2011, posting in English and Russian. On October 24, 2014, Queen Elizabeth II sent her first tweet to mark the opening of the London Science Museum's Information Age exhibition. A 2013 study by website Twiplomacy found that 153 of the 193 countries represented at the United Nations had established government Twitter accounts. The same study also found that those accounts amounted to 505 Twitter handles used by world leaders and their foreign ministers, with their tweets able to reach a combined audience of over 106 million followers.According to an analysis of accounts, the heads of state of 125 countries and 139 other leading politicians have Twitter accounts that have between them sent more than 350,000 tweets and have almost 52 million followers. However, only 30 of these do their own tweeting, more than 80 do not subscribe to other politicians and many do not follow any accounts.45th President of the United States Donald Trump has used Twitter as a method of providing ideas and information as a Presidential Candidate, Presidential Elect, and President during the 2016 election season and forward after his election. A study performed at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology showed his tweets from these different time periods and through analysis of his tweets, the professors found that President Trump uses a mode called \\\"forensic mode\\\" the most often in his tweets. This is described as a quick reactive usage, as they found he often used Twitter to show his judgement of the events that occurred regarding both his allies and his enemies. After his election to the presidency he tweeted this \\\"forensic-style\\\" tweet, \\\"Just had a very open and successful election. Now professional protesters, incited by the media, are protesting. Very Unfair!\\\".In a study done at New York University in 2015, an analysis and comparison of the Twitter accounts of Donald Trump, Jeb Bush, Bernie Sanders, and Hillary Clinton, found observations showing the goals of each candidate's Twitter during their respective primary elections. Some comparisons that were made were the use of Aristotle's theory of Rhetoric. The research found that Donald Trump used pathos, the appeal to emotion, in his rhetoric; Bernie Sanders tended to use ethos and logos for his Twitter; Hillary Clinton tended to use logos and pathos to try to convey her values, and Jeb Bush shows that he uses a mix of all three on his account. The study also looked at the media response to the tweets during the election. The study found that the tweets became more persuasive for the candidates if the media put the tweets in front of more viewers, versus less powerful if they were only visible to those already on Twitter. In that way, presidential candidates who had their tweets covered more in the news were able to get their message to more potential voters.\\n\\n\\n==== Religion ====\\nMore than twenty Roman Catholic cardinals manage active Twitter accounts, nine of whom were cardinal electors for the 2013 Papal conclave. Pope Benedict XVI's Twitter account was set up in 2012. As of April 2016, his successor, Pope Francis, has 9.06 million followers of his Twitter account (@Pontifex).In a 2015 European Foundation for Democracy-European Policy Centre policy dialogue panel in Brussels, Mark Wallace, CEO of the \\\"CounterExtremism Project\\\" and former U.S ambassador to the United Nations, said: \\\"Twitter is currently the 'gateway drug' for those seeking to recruit fighters for Islamic terrorism and this must be stopped.\\\"\\n\\n\\n==== Twitterbot effect ====\\nTwitterbots are capable of influencing public opinion about culture, products and political agendas by automatically generating mass amounts of tweets through imitating human communication. The New York Times states, \\\"They have sleep-wake cycles so their fakery is more convincing, making them less prone to repetitive patterns that flag them as mere programs.\\\" The tweets generated vary anywhere from a simple automated response to content creation and information sharing, all of which depends on the intention of the person purchasing or creating the bot. The social implications these Twitterbots potentially have on human perception are sizeable according to a study published by the ScienceDirect Journal. Looking at the Computers as Social Actors (CASA) paradigm, the journal notes, \\\"people exhibit remarkable social reactions to computers and other media, treating them as if they were real people or real places.\\\" The study concluded that Twitterbots were viewed as credible and competent in communication and interaction making them suitable for transmitting information in the social media sphere. While the technological advances have enabled the ability of successful Human-Computer Interaction, the implications are questioned due to the appearance of both benign and malicious bots in the Twitter realm. Benign Twitterbots may generate creative content and relevant product updates whereas malicious bots can make unpopular people seem popular, push irrelevant products on users and spread misinformation, spam and/or slander.In addition to content-generating bots, users can purchase followers, favorites, retweets and comments on various websites that cater to expanding a user's image through accumulation of followers. With more followers, users' profiles gain more attention, thus increasing their popularity. Generating Web traffic is a valuable commodity for both individuals and businesses because it indicates notability. With Twitterbots, users are able to create the illusion of \\\"buzz\\\" on their site by obtaining followers from services such as Swenzy and underground suppliers who operate bot farms or click farms. The companies that facilitate this service create fake Twitter accounts that follow a number of people, some of these Twitter accounts may even post fake tweets to make it seem like they are real. This practice of obtaining mass amounts of twitterbots as followers is not permitted on Twitter. The emphasis on followers and likes as a measure of social capital has urged people to extend their circle to weak and latent ties to promote the idea of popularity for celebrities, politicians, musicians, public figures, and companies alike. According to The New York Times, bots amass significant influence and have been noted to sway elections, influence the stock market, public appeal, and attack governments.\\n\\n\\n=== GCHQ ===\\nAccording to documents leaked by Edward Snowden and published in July 2014, the United Kingdom's GCHQ has a tool named BIRDSONG for \\\"automated posting of Twitter updates\\\", and a tool named BIRDSTRIKE for \\\"Twitter monitoring and profile collection\\\".\\n\\n\\n== Television ==\\nTwitter is also increasingly used for making TV more interactive and social. This effect is sometimes referred to as the second screen, \\\"virtual watercooler\\\" or social television--the practice has been called \\\"chatterboxing\\\". Twitter has been successfully used to encourage people to watch live TV events, such as the Oscars, the Super Bowl and the MTV Video Music Awards; however this strategy has proven less effective with regularly scheduled TV shows. Such direct cross-promotions have been banned from French television due to regulations against secret advertising.In December 2012, Twitter and Nielsen entered a multi-year agreement to produce social TV ratings, which are expected to be commercially available for the fall 2013 season as the Nielsen Twitter TV Rating. Advertising Age said Twitter had become the new TV Guide. Then in February 2013, Twitter acquired Bluefin Labs for an estimated US$50 million to $100 million. Founded in 2008 at the MIT Media Lab, Bluefin is a data miner whose analysis tells which brands (e.g., TV shows and companies) are chatted about the most in social media. MIT Technology Review said that Bluefin gives Twitter part of the US$72 billion television advertising market.In May 2013, it launched Twitter Amplify--an advertising product for media and consumer brands. With Amplify, Twitter runs video highlights from major live broadcasts, with advertisers' names and messages playing before the clip. In October 2013, Comcast announced that it had partnered with Twitter to implement its \\\"See It\\\" feature within the service, allowing posts promoting programs on selected NBCUniversal channels to contain direct links to TV Everywhere streaming to the program. On launch, the concept was limited to NBCUniversal channels and Xfinity cable television subscribers.In an attempt to compete with Twitter's leadership in TV, Facebook introduced a number of features in 2013 to drive conversation about TV including hashtags, verified profiles and embeddable posts. It also opened up new data visualization APIs for TV news and other media outlets, enabling them to search for a word and see a firehose of public posts that mention it as well as show how many people mentioned a word in both public and private posts during a set time frame, with a demographic breakdown of the age, gender, and location of these people. In January 2014, Facebook announced a partnership with UK-based social TV analytics company SecondSync which saw the social network make its social TV available outside the company for the first time. Facebook struck the partnership to help marketers understand how people are using the social network to talk about topics such as TV. However, Twitter responded by acquiring SecondSync and Parisian social TV firm Mesagraph three months later. These acquisitions, as well as a partnership with research company Kantar (which it had been working with to develop a suite of analytics tools for the British TV industry since August 2013) strengthened Twitter's dominance of the \\\"second screen\\\" - TV viewers using tablets and smartphones to share their TV experience on social media. With the additional analytic tools, Twitter was able to improve the firm's offering to advertisers, allowing them to, for instance, only promote a tweet onto the timelines of users who were watching a certain programme.By February 2014, all four major U.S. TV networks had signed up to the Amplify program, bringing a variety of premium TV content onto the social platform in the form of in-tweet real-time video clips. In March 2014, ITV became the first major broadcaster in the UK to sign up to Twitter Amplify and Twitter introduced one-tap video playback across its mobile apps to further enhance the consumer experience.In June 2014, Twitter acquired its Amplify partner in the U.S., SnappyTV. In Europe, Twitter's Amplify partner is London-based Grabyo, which has also struck numerous deals with broadcasters and rights holders to share video content across Facebook and Twitter. In July 2017, Twitter announced that it would wind down SnappyTV as a separate company, and integrate its features into the Media Studio suite on Twitter.\\n\\n\\n== Statistics ==\\n\\n\\n=== User accounts with large follower base ===\\n\\nAs of August 2, 2018, the ten Twitter accounts with the most followers were:\\n\\n\\n=== Oldest accounts ===\\nThe oldest Twitter accounts are 14 accounts that became active on March 21, 2006, all belonging to Twitter employees at the time and including @jack (Jack Dorsey), @biz (Biz Stone), and @noah (Noah Glass).\\n\\n\\n=== Record tweets ===\\n\\nA selfie orchestrated by 86th Academy Awards host Ellen DeGeneres during the March 2, 2014 broadcast was at the time the most retweeted image ever. DeGeneres said she wanted to homage Meryl Streep's record 17 Oscar nominations by setting a new record with her, and invited other Oscar celebrities to join them. The resulting photo of twelve celebrities broke the previous retweet record within forty minutes, and was retweeted over 1.8 million times in the first hour. By the end of the ceremony it had been retweeted over 2 million times; less than 24 hours later, it had been retweeted over 2.8 million times. As of  18 March 2014, it has been retweeted over 3.4 million times. The group selfie effort was parodied by Lego, and Matt Groening with The Simpsons. It beat the previous record, 778,801, which was held by Barack Obama, following his victory in the 2012 presidential election. On May 9, 2017, Ellen's record was broken by Carter Wilkerson (@carterjwm) by collecting nearly 3.5 million retweets in a little over a month.According to Guinness World Records, the fastest pace to a million followers was set by actor Robert Downey Jr. in 23 hours and 22 minutes in April 2014. This record was later broken by Caitlyn Jenner, who joined the site on June 1, 2015 and amassed a million followers in just 4 hours and 3 minutes.\\nThe most tweeted moment in the history of Twitter occurred on August 2, 2013; during a Japanese television airing of the Studio Ghibli film Castle in the Sky, fans simultaneously tweeted the word balse (barusu)--the incantation for a destruction spell used during its climax, after it was uttered in the film. There was a global peak of 143,199 tweets in one second, beating the previous record of 33,388.The most discussed event in Twitter history occurred on October 24, 2015; the hashtag (\\\"#ALDubEBTamangPanahon\\\") for Tamang Panahon, a live special episode of the Filipino variety show Eat Bulaga! at the Philippine Arena, centering on its popular on-air couple AlDub, attracted 41 million tweets. The most-discussed sporting event in Twitter history was the 2014 FIFA World Cup semi-final between Brazil and Germany on July 8, 2014.On the day of the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Twitter proved to be the largest source of breaking news, with over 40 million tweets sent that day.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\n\\nAmbient awareness\\nComparison of microblogging services\\nList of mergers and acquisitions by Twitter\\nList of virtual communities with more than 100 million users\\nTwitterature\\nTwitter usage--How various people and organizations use Twitter\\nTimeline of social media\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== Further reading ==\\nFitton, Laura; Gruen, Michael E.; Poston, Leslie; foreword by Jack Dorsey (2009).

Wolf received generally positive reviews from critics and debuted at number three on the US Billboard 200, selling 89,000 copies in its first week.\\n\\n\\n== Background and production ==\\nIn November 2011, in an interview with Spin, Tyler expressed wanting to shift away from the themes of his previous albums, stating: \\n\\n\\n== Music and lyrics ==\\nThematically, Wolf slightly departs from the horrorcore lyrics of debut mixtape Bastard and debut studio album Goblin. It is a concept album that features a continuous story of characters Wolf, Sam and Salem. Therapist character Dr. TC makes his last appearance on a Tyler album on the final track \\\"Lone\\\". The story presented in Wolf has been said to link to Tyler's two previous projects, with debates occurring on whether Wolf comes chronologically before or after Goblin.Craig Jenkins of Pitchfork describes the track \\\"IFHY\\\" as \\\"a bit of Neptunes worship so adroit that its plinking synths and jazzy chord changes give way to a falsettoed coda from Pharrell himself\\\". Jenkins also compared the posse cut \\\"Rusty\\\" to the sound of Wu-Tang Clan, featuring \\\"a lush reimagining of 1990s RZA production\\\". \\\"Trashwang\\\" has been described as a tongue-in-cheek spoof of rapper Waka Flocka Flame's 2011 song \\\"Turnt Up Niggaz\\\". Kathy Iandoli of Billboard compared the song \\\"Colossus\\\" to Eminem's 2000 hit, \\\"Stan\\\", stating that Tyler \\\"continuously switches the lyrics from being cutesy fanfare to sexually maniacal\\\".\\n\\n\\n== Release and promotion ==\\nOn February 14, 2013, OFWGKTA posted a video to their YouTube account, which includes L-Boy skydiving and stating that Wolf will be released on April 2, 2013. On the same day, Tyler revealed three different album covers via his Instagram account. The deluxe version of the album features a fold-out poster of the full album cover artwork that was designed by Mark Ryden, a limited embroidered patch, a Wolf calendar and a 24-page booklet featuring lyrics and artwork. Four days after the album's release, Tyler released the whole album for free streaming services through his SoundCloud account.From March 11, 2013 to April 11, 2013, Tyler toured North America and Europe on the Wolf tour. The tour was his first solo tour without his group Odd Future. His first stop was Boulder, Colorado and the Wolf release party took place in Los Angeles, California on the release day of the album. He announced he would extend the tour from April 30 to May 18, 2013. These shows took place on the west coast of the United States and it features his Odd Future cohort, Earl Sweatshirt. On September 9, 2013, Tyler released a trailer for a film based on Wolf.\\n\\n\\n=== Singles ===\\nThe album's lead single, \\\"Domo23\\\", was released on February 14, 2013, as well an accompanying music video which features cameo appearances from Odd Future members Domo Genesis, Earl Sweatshirt, Jasper Dolphin and Taco. The song peaked at number two on the US Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles and at number 37 on the US Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs. At the end of the video for \\\"Domo23\\\", it previewed the video for the reported second single, \\\"Bimmer\\\" featuring Odd Future member Frank Ocean.\\n\\n\\n=== Other songs ===\\nOn March 29, 2013, the music video was released for \\\"IFHY\\\" featuring Pharrell. At the end of the video, the song cuts into a snippet of the music video for \\\"Jamba\\\" featuring Odd Future member Hodgy Beats. In the music video, Tyler \\\"plays a lovestruck doll, acting out scenes in a dollhouse with a plastic girlfriend. While the real-life Tyler later drives through a neighborhood with Hodgy Beats as his song \\\"Jamba\\\" blasts from the speakers.\\\" \\\"IFHY\\\" peaked at number 24 on the US Heatseekers Songs. On October 7, 2013, the music video was released for both \\\"Tamale\\\" and \\\"Answer\\\".\\n\\n\\n== Critical reception ==\\nWolf received generally positive reviews from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album has received an average score of 70, based on 31 reviews. Craig Jenkins of Pitchfork said, \\\"With Wolf, Tyler, the Creator displays a radical growth as a producer, composer and arranger, even if, as a rapper, he's still up to some of the same antics. Still, the album contains a few of the best songs he's ever written.\\\" Jeremy D. Larson of Consequence of Sound said, \\\"Tyler is his own worst enemy, of course. But the buoyancy of the production and the overall intrigue of hearing him struggle with his idle hands prevent the album from getting mired down in too much vanity.\\\" David Jeffries of AllMusic said, \\\"It's a fun album for fanatics, but the willingness to shock feels too comfortable at this point, so those who found it tiresome before will likely find it devastating here.\\\" Chris Dart of Exclaim! felt that \\\"While Tyler will almost certainly never outgrow life as a weird, hell-raising provocateur, Wolf shows that he's already growing into life as a smart, diverse artist.\\\"Slant Magazine's Jesse Cataldo commenting \\\"The production is routinely strong, but things are weighed down by Tyler himself, who forcefully refuses to provide a palatable anchor to over an hour's worth of material.\\\" Cataldo saw the album as \\\"progress on some fronts\\\", but felt that Tyler \\\"needs to move beyond certain issues\\\" to \\\"prove himself a vital force.\\\" Martin Caballero of The Boston Globe said, \\\"Despite careering from one alter ego to the next and touching on everything from his absent father on \\\"Answer\\\" to the art of making campfire s'mores on the seven-minute \\\"PartyIsntOver  / Campfire  / Bimmer\\\", there's a broad vision and deft execution that holds things together much better than on Goblin.\\\" Eric Diep of XXL said, \\\"Wolf meets its own high expectations by creating an absorbing journey of Tyler's imagination. Everything from being his own therapist to poking fun at newfound fame is documented in captivating fashion, however juvenile it may be at times. There's still growing up to do, and maybe time will tame the fascinating artist we see on this album. Until then, there's no escaping his meteoric rise. And the diehard Odd Future fans will love every minute of it.\\\"David Amidon of PopMatters said, \\\"If Wolf is not Goblin is the most important statement I feel like I could make about this album, the second most important thing I can probably say about it is that nothing has actually changed about Tyler himself. All his flaws as a coherent lyricist and person are on full display throughout the album, and the charm or lack thereof of that fact goes a long way towards how enjoyable this album can be.\\\" Jessica Hopper of Spin magazine felt that \\\"Wolf's most grievous misstep, and its one true spiritual connection to the superior Bastard and Goblin: Tyler's defiant use of the word 'faggot.' As usual, he spends a ton of time here bragging about how little he cares about how the world sees him, but his reliance on the other f-bomb to keep our attention suggests otherwise.\\\" Chris Kelly of Fact said, \\\"With Wolf, Tyler, the Creator is exciting again: maybe not as the ringleader of the Odd Future empire, but as a producer who just turned 22 (did you forget how young he actually is?), has internalized a decade of Neptunes / Doom / Def Jux production, and has Pharrell, Erykah, and (most importantly) Frank Ocean on speed dial. The don't-give-a-fuck attitude might have run its course lyrically, but when applying it as a production ethos, Tyler is just getting started.\\\"\\n\\n\\n=== Accolades ===\\nXXL ranked it at number 18 on their list of the best albums of 2013. They commented saying, \\\"The leader of the Odd Future crew's second album Wolf displayed radical maturity--both musically and lyrically; partnering with fellow Odd Future members Frank Ocean and Earl Sweatshirt, alongside Pharrell Williams and even Erykah Badu on songs involving gripping narratives of personal frustrations and heartbreak. Coupled with vivid lyrics and stark synth production, Tyler's fascinatingly still weird but insightful and musically pleasing.\\\" HipHopDX named it one of the top 25 albums of 2013. They elaborated saying, \\\"Wolf was Tyler's most grown up effort to date. Developing into a fully realized production mastermind, he somehow tied a summer camp story in with his usual themes of relationships and the struggles of fame, not to mention the ghetto's crack epidemic and bullying leading to school shootings.\\\"\\n\\n\\n== Commercial performance ==\\nIn the United States, Wolf debuted at number three on the US Billboard 200, selling 89,000 copies in the first week. In its second week, the album sold 18,000 more copies bringing its sales total to 107,000 in the United States.\\n\\n\\n== Track listing ==\\nAll songs produced by Tyler, the Creator, except for the final track \\\"Lone\\\", which is produced by Wilson das Neves.\\nNotes\\n\\n\\\"Jamba\\\" contains an uncredited appearance from Domo Genesis\\n\\\"Cowboy\\\" contains an uncredited appearance from Lego-Head\\n\\\"Awkward\\\" and \\\"48\\\" contain uncredited appearances from Frank Ocean\\n\\\"48\\\" contains an uncredited appearance from Nas\\n\\\"Rusty\\\" contains an uncredited appearance from Jason Dill\\nSyd tha Kyd is uncredited with contributing vocals on \\\"Answer\\\"\\nElijah Hall, Parys Hall and Jaslyn Leonti are uncredited with contributing vocals on \\\"Campfire\\\"\\nTallullah Willis is uncredited with contributing vocals on \\\"Tamale\\\"\\n\\n\\n== Personnel ==\\nCredits for Wolf adapted from AllMusic.\\n\\n\\n== Charts ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\", \"rev_id\": 857287885, \"accessed\": \"2018-09-03 00:23:59.864295\", \"links\": [\"RED Distribution\", \"Billboard (magazine)\", \"AllMusic\", \"Wu-Tang Clan\", \"Consequence of Sound\", \"Pitchfork (website)\", \"Fact (UK magazine)\", \"Single (music)\", \"The Boston Globe\", \"Los Angeles\", \"Jasper Dolphin\", \"Mark Ryden\", \"Domo Genesis\", \"Pharrell Williams\", \"Heatseekers Songs\", \"Odd Future\", \"Waka Flocka Flame\", \"Left Brain\", \"Boulder, Colorado\", \"YouTube\", \"HipHopDX\", \"Odd Future Records\", \"Domo23\", \"Syd tha Kyd\", \"Earl Sweatshirt\", \"Tyler, the Creator\", \"Genesis (Domo Genesis album)\", \"Spin (magazine)\", \"Earl (mixtape)\", \"Bastard (Tyler, the Creator album)\", \"Erykah Badu\", \"Instagram\", \"Frank Ocean\", \"Hodgy\", \"Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles\", \"Bastard (Tyler, The Creator album)\", \"Exclaim!\", \"Goblin (album)\", \"RZA\", \"Stan (song)\", \"XXL (magazine)\", \"Mike G\", \"Syd (singer)\", \"Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs\", \"Metacritic\", \"Eminem\", \"PopMatters\", \"Wilson das Neves\", \"Slant Magazine\", \"Bastard (Tyler, the Creator mixtape)\", \"Billboard 200\", \"SoundCloud\", \"Wolf (Tyler, The Creator album)\", \"Nas\"]}, {\"title\": \"The OF Tape Vol. 2\", \"link_id\": \"The OF Tape Vol. 2\", \"summary\": \"The OF Tape Vol. 2 is the only studio album by American hip hop collective Odd Future.

Critics generally praised the presence of Tyler and Ocean, the vintage style of production and album closer, \\\"Oldie\\\".\\n\\n\\n== Background and recording ==\\nLos Angeles hip hop collective Odd Future; who they were known for their frequent collaborations, releasing mixtapes together in the past, such as Radical and the original Odd Future Tape. In January 2012, the group confirmed that they were to release their first commercially released album, titled The OF Tape Vol. 2. The album was to feature production and appearances by only Odd Future members, and would be promoted with a North American tour.The album was quickly recorded in Los Angeles over the course of two weeks. In an interview with The Guardian, when asked about the expectations of the album, Tyler replied \\\"I don't know. I have my doubts. Everybody's going on it and I just think, fuck, everybody might hate this shit. Everybody might go: 'What the fuck is this? We wanted this, we wanted that.' There we go. We made an album we wanted to make. If everybody hates it, OK. We have an album we like.\\\" The track \\\"Forest Green\\\" was released over a year before the release of the album but was featured on the project with remastered production.\\n\\n\\n== Content ==\\n \\nThe album opener \\\"Hi\\\", is a song where group member L-Boy insults each \\\"dusty ass motherfucker\\\" on the album, serving as a comical hip hop skit. \\\"Bitches\\\" is performed by Hodgy and Domo, with production by Left Brain. The track is a \\\"boastful\\\" scorcher, built from New Age synthesizers and hammering snare drums. The two rappers trade off-kilter verses at each other, with Hodgy delivering his verses with a melodic flow. Hodgy \\\"turns up the aggression\\\" on \\\"NY (Ned Flander)\\\", a track similar to the aesthetic of Tyler's album Goblin. Critics noted the song's \\\"stark\\\", \\\"unnerving\\\" and repetitive piano line that serves as the platform for Tyler and Hodgy's verses. Nathan Rabin wrote that all the songs up to \\\"NY (Ned Flander)\\\" are rap songs, but the one that follows, \\\"Ya Know\\\", is not, as it is more reminiscent of the band N.E.R.D. with its sonic shifts and \\\"hazy\\\" atmosphere. The track is performed by Matt Martians and Syd the Kyd of psych-soul act The Internet, with jazz influences.Mike G is the only performer on \\\"Forest Green\\\", which reviewers described as a lurching banger with a creepy, hypnotic beat. \\\"Lean\\\" is a parody song in the style of Waka Flocka Flame, an absurdist take on rap music with lines like \\\"If I was a dinosaur, I'd be a flexasaurus\\\". Syd the Kyd makes another singing appearance on \\\"Analog 2\\\". The song features Ocean singing a chorus over a production of what writers thought of as atmospheric, with a sultry swirl of synths, and a segue with 12 seconds of silence. Tyler raps with relative innocence about hanging out with his girlfriend, and Syd the Kid muses about moonlight kisses and rooftop sexual encounters. Hodgy is the main contributor to \\\"50\\\", a bass-driven, comical song that takes cues from the comedy troupe The Lonely Island. \\\"50\\\" demonstrates both an aggressive and comical side to the album, with verses like \\\"I'll fuck your grandmother up.\\\"Hodgy reappears on \\\"Snow White\\\", featuring more singing from Ocean. Hodgy Beats raps at a very fast rate, centered on an intense beat. The 10th track is \\\"Rella\\\", where Tyler boasts about taking \\\"three pills of Extenzo\\\" to cure his erectile dysfunction, in a flow similar to rapper Eminem.  The production was handled by Left Brain, with elements of electronic music, sounding like \\\"something out of a Donkey Kong Country level.\\\" MellowHype and Taco contemplate the issues of having not having an ideal woman on  \\\"Real Bitch\\\". The track was written to be purposely offensive, with the two rappers trading verses on what reviewers described as an atmospheric, \\\"slow-jam\\\" beat. \\\"P\\\" features a bass-driven beat influence by post-grunge, with Tyler rapping in the vein of the Wu-Tang Clan. The song features casual references to Jerry Sandusky and Casey Anthony, and Tyler's description of his flow being as \\\"retarded as the sound of deaf people arguing.\\\"\\\"White\\\" features Ocean alone, and is similar to a song from his album Channel Orange with the same name. The song is a vast departure from the rest of the album, featuring Ocean gently singing in the style of Stevie Wonder. Ocean speaks a contemplative poem about the transitory mystery of love, with the song serving as an intermission from the more aggressive style of the album. The song is followed by \\\"Hcapd\\\", with heavy synths played over Left Brain's verses about horror-related topics. Taco and Jasper Dolphin appear on the comical track \\\"We Got Bitches\\\", another absurdist parody composition. The song has a chaotic beat, taking influence from punk rock and rave music. Braggadocio rapping is prominent on the track, with the crew screaming the chorus \\\"We got bitches, we got diamonds, we got cars, we got jacuzzis,\\\" adding \\\"and yo' bitch be on my dick!\\\" The album closer is \\\"Oldie\\\", where Earl Sweatshirt makes his first rapping appearance in over a year. The song is a 10-minute track featuring, in order of appearance on the song, Taco, Tyler, Hodgy Beats, Left Brain, Mike G, Domo Genesis, Frank Ocean, Jasper Dolphin and Earl Sweatshirt, with Tyler closing the song with another verse. The song features the collective's blending of eccentricity and rebellion, and each rapper taking a verse to express their own topics of interest lyrically.\\n\\n\\n== Promotion ==\\n\\nOn February 20, 2012, the music video for single \\\"Rella\\\" premiered online. The video was directed by Tyler, and according to Pitchfork Media's Jordan Sargent. The video can be summarized as \\\"Hodgy Beats shoots lasers from his crotch turning girls into cats, while Domo Genesis smacks a black girl in the face, turning her into an Asian, and Tyler as a coke-snorting centaur.\\\"The music video for \\\"NY (Ned Flander)\\\", also directed by Tyler, was premiered on March 5. The video contained scenes of Hodgy as a bald, deadbeat dad preoccupied with softcore porn, and Tyler's head on a baby's body.The music video for \\\"Oldie\\\", directed by Lance Bangs, was released on March 20. The video was shot during at a Terry Richardson's photo shoot featuring the entire group, the collective decided to shoot an impromptu video, lip-syncing their verses. The rappers interrupt each other, while laughing and smile for the majority of the video.\\\"Sam (Is Dead)\\\" was promoted as a short film, directed by Tyler. The short film is a war-themed comedic narrative, featuring Sweatshirt, Tyler, L-Boy, and even Lee Spielman of Odd Future Records's Trash Talk. Odd Future have performed several of the songs from the album on their tours. During Ocean's 2012 setlist at the Coachella Music Festival, Tyler joined Ocean on stage for a performance of \\\"Analog 2\\\".\\n\\n\\n== Critical reception ==\\nThe OF Tape Vol. 2 received mostly positive reviews from music critics. Pitchfork's Jordan Sargent stated that the album was mostly a success because \\\"every member steps up\\\", with Domo who had \\\"evolved from the group's bumbling stoner into a guy who can spit dizzying, complicated verses\\\". Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone stated that the album contained a \\\"fizzy energy that elevates it above its limitations\\\", musing that Odd Future were a lot like \\\"early Wu-Tang, a thrilling regional act, and a bunch of whip-smart black hipsters whose worldview is grounded in their corner of sun-baked  southern California.\\\" PopMatters's Jeff Dunn felt that every member improved from their past mixtapes, stating that Ocean, Tyler, and Sweatshirt were all impressive, consistently \\\"spitting dizzying, more original lines than they ever have on mixtapes past.\\\" Dunn wrote that \\\"after the mixed returns of Goblin, Tyler himself now seems to realize that less is more on his part\\\", who \\\"wisely tones down the shock-for-shock's-sake rhymes quite a bit, making his appearances all the more rewarding when they do occur.\\\" Steve Labate of Paste mused that \\\"while Odd Future's critics try hard to frame them as such, it's difficult to accept Tyler and the OF crew as mere shock artists, flippantly tossing off incendiary slurs for attention--the music is too tongue-in-cheek clever, too brainy and self-aware, too anything-goes eccentric.\\\"The A.V. Club's Chris Martins praised the album, stating that \\\"perhaps most impressive is that Tyler, the Creator takes a noticeable step back so that his friends can enjoy the spotlight. When he does show up--standouts include the hulking G-funk mutation \\\"Hcapd\\\" and the grungy, bass-addled \\\"P\\\"--both his beats and raps thrill: All of the twisted jokes, tough introspection, and rabble-rousing that fans have come to expect, with none of the unfortunate rape references his detractors rightly called him on.\\\" Allmusic's David Jeffries called album closer \\\"Oldie\\\" epic in nature, stating that Earl Sweatshirt's return was the highlight of the album, summarizing the album as \\\"hype warranted.\\\" Beats Per Minute's Craig Jenkin compared the album extensively to prior Odd Future releases, reporting that \\\"it ditches the expansive ooze that made stretches of Tyler's Goblin a chore, the nihilistic agitprop of MellowHype's BlackenedWhite, and the lackadaisical drugginess of Mike G's Ali and Domo's Rolling Papers in favor of the kind of restless, jerky energy that skyrocketed Bastard into the dialogue months prior.\\\" He described the album as something that \\\"mainly sounds like a bunch of dudes in a dank basement cooking up the wildest smack talk possible, with one-upping each other being the primary objective.\\\"Jeff Reiss of Spin gave the album a mixed review, commenting that \\\"it's Odd Future at their best, blending eccentricity, rebellion, and weird humor, with the fearlessness of kids convinced that there are no consequences to their actions\\\", though noted that \\\"at their worst, they are guilty of every adolescent's biggest fear - being boring.\\\" Ray Rhamen, writer for Entertainment Weekly gave a mixed review, reporting that \\\"robbed of their outsider status, the  boys swap horror for hormones on The OF Tape, Vol 2., giddily trading tall tales and witty obscenities. For better or worse, OF might actually be growing up.\\\" musicOMH's Andy Baber viewed the album as \\\"an eclectic and solid - if unspectacular - return, which should see their already dedicated fanbase increase\\\", commenting that \\\"Frank Ocean is criminally underused\\\". Mike Madden of Consequence of Sound felt that \\\"too many things happen here, from the Brick Squad-type rave-ups to Ocean's R&B laments, for it to ever sound like a truly unified, full-length group project.\\\"\\n\\n\\n== Commercial performance ==\\nIn the United States, the album debuted at number 5 on the Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 40,000 copies. As of May 2012, the album has sold 71,000 copies in the United States. The album topped the US Billboard Top Rap Albums chart, the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, and the Top Independent Albums chart. It also charted within the top 40 in Australia, Canada, Denmark and the UK.

In 1910, the Metropolitan Opera paid Hammerstein $1.2 million to stop operating the Manhattan Opera House as an opera venue for ten years. This led to the elaborately decorated theater being used for a variety of events, including vaudeville.The ownership of the center changed hands multiple times over the next few decades, with the theater being converted into a large ballroom and being used as a Freemason's temple in the 1930s and a trade union headquarters in the 1940s before falling into disuse in the 1970s, before being bought by Sun Myung Moon's Unification Church, the ballroom's current owner. The building was renamed Manhattan Center Studios in 1986, and in 1997 the former theater was renamed the Hammerstein Ballroom and underwent extensive renovation, with the hand painted ceiling being completely restored.\\n\\n\\n== Notable events ==\\nThe Hammerstein Ballroom has seen performances from a wide variety of musical acts and its popularity has varied over the years due mainly to competition within the neighborhood.\\nThe professional wrestling promotion Extreme Championship Wrestling staged some of its events from the Ballroom.

When he was at the age of 10, his family moved to New Orleans, Louisiana. He made the decision to pursue a career in music at a young age, and as a teen, he did neighborhood chores to fund his early studio sessions. After Hurricane Katrina hit his hometown of New Orleans, Ocean moved to Los Angeles to pursue a recording career. He initially had problems maintaining a career while juggling a job, due to spending too much time in the recording studios, making him late for his jobs. He began to write songs and he sold them to other recording artists; selling his first song to Noel Gourdin at the age of 19. Discussing as to why he chose to write songs, Ocean commented that \\\"I feel at a higher level of consciousness when I'm being creative.\\\"Eventually, he landed songwriting gigs for established artists like Brandy, John Legend, and Justin Bieber where he made substantially more money. In late 2009, he met producer Tricky Stewart, who helped Ocean sign a contract with Def Jam Recordings as a solo artist. However, he was initially unable to build a relationship with the company. In protest, Ocean joined the rap collective Odd Future which introduced him to artists such as Tyler, The Creator and Hodgy Beats. His debut song was \\\"SteamRoller\\\" on the Domo Genesis album Rolling Papers. Ocean garnered acclaim and generated interest while in the group, and Rolling Stone magazine's Jonah Weiner called him a \\\"gifted avant-R&B smoothie\\\". During his time with the group he recorded and self-released Nostalgia, Ultra without any pre-release promotion on his Tumblr account.\\n\\n\\n== Music and lyrics ==\\nThe mixtape samples songs from Radiohead, Coldplay, MGMT, Mr. Hudson and The Eagles, which Ocean sings over. Ocean, when uploading the album to iTunes, labeled it as bluegrass and death metal, out of arbitrariness. When asked about why he uploaded the songs in that way, he replied; \\\"I don't want to seem like I have a cause against genres, or maybe I do... Bluegrass is swag. Bluegrass is all the way swag.\\\" Ocean described the making of his mixtape as a labor of love, stating that \\\"It was like difficult to make. Not like writing the songs [or] arranging the songs. That had a level of difficulty, too. But just piecing together all the levels to do it at the level, the quality of records I wanted to make... But, it was a process I appreciate so much.\\\"In his own words, Ocean calls the album \\\"nostalgic.\\\" He explains, \\\"it's a longing for the past. That's what this record felt like.\\\" The lyrical content, according to Ocean, relates to heartbreak and other familiar tropes of interpersonal relationships: \\\"I wasn't trying to make a record that people could relate to. I was just trying to make a record with the shit that I wanted to express. The shit that I wanted to get off my chest. [...] A lot of this record is influenced by one relationship, but I don't owe that whole project to one situation. It doesn't matter what the details of it are.\\\" Discussing the writing process behind the album, he mused that he was just inspired to tell stories. He continued, \\\"you gotta make sure the listener is listening to you, so if you put it into a song, often times, if the song is striking enough, then you can really deliver the story most effectively while keeping the ear of the listener the whole time. I guess it all starts with the stories for me.\\\"When asked by The Quietus if the songs from the album drew from his personal experiences, Frank commented \\\"My kitchen is usually pretty clean, you know. But you have fun with the imagery, and for me the whole concept that everything has to be... Like, nobody gets upset with a director when a director's film isn't about his life. People think that with a recording artist that shit has to be like a fucking play by play of their whole life, but it's not. It's imagery, and a little bit of satire.\\\" When asked if he made R&B music, Ocean replied that he disliked how that in the United States, \\\"if you're a singer and you're black, you're an R&B artist. Period.\\\" Ocean stated that the songs on the mixtape do contain R&B influences, but that it is not an R&B album entirely.\\n\\n\\n== Songs ==\\nThe album begins with a melodic cover of \\\"Strawberry Swing\\\" by English alternative rock band Coldplay. Connor O'Neill of The Miscellany News writes that the cover begins the album with \\\"so much atmosphere you almost melt into it\\\" and then \\\"spreads you over an apocalyptic swan song\\\". The song ends abruptly with the rude sound of an alarm clock, followed by the \\\"nightmarish\\\" song \\\"Novacane\\\". It has been called a love song of sorts, with influence taken from alternative hip hop group The Pharcyde. Lyrically the track explores a narrative in which the singer meets a girl attempting to pay her way through dental school by working in porn. Ocean meets the girl at Coachella, a musical festival which takes place in Indio, California. Ocean serves as the protagonist in the song, in love with a girl \\\"so gone on drugs that Ocean, wanting to be close to her, has no choice but to get gone on those same drugs\\\". The pair get high using dental local anesthetics. Ocean serves as an unreliable narrator.Several interludes are placed throughout the album, named after video games, such as Street Fighter, Metal Gear Solid, GoldenEye 007 and Soulcalibur. This is reported to give the album a more nostalgic feel; the record is \\\"held together by tiny interludes named after 1990s video games in which the unmistakable sounds of a cassette player rewinding, fast-forwarding, and stopping are heard\\\". On the track \\\"We All Try\\\", Ocean speaks out against homophobia. According to The Guardian, \\\"Odd Future's frequent use of the word 'faggot' unsettled liberal stomachs\\\", and that \\\"Ocean was brave enough to stand alone once more, declaring on 'We All Try': 'I believe that marriage isn't between a man and woman, but between love and love'. On the same song he reveals his opinion of the pro-choice debate: 'I believe a woman's temple, gives her the right to choose/ But baby don't abort.'\\\" He obliquely \\\"announces his support of a woman's right to choose and gay marriage\\\", both of which are \\\"hardly typical r&b tropes.\\\" The song contains \\\"smooth, bedroom-type grooves\\\".Pitchfork Media wrote that \\\"in a skit called \\\"Bitches Talkin\\\", the ladies tell him to cut it out with the damn Radiohead, while \\\"Optimistic\\\" is playing in the background; in 'Songs For Women', he obliges--he's an indie kid when it comes to alienation but a pragmatist when it comes to sex.\\\" \\\"Songs For Women\\\" is a song where Ocean can't decide whether to rue or revel in his conflicted feelings about women. The song offers a self-effacing perspective, with a numbed, restrained delivery. Lyrically the track expresses a narrative where he tries to arrange an after-school meeting in his dad's empty house and brags about harmonizing to Otis, Isley and Marvin. He laments that his woman doesn't listen to him or his music: \\\"It's like she never heard of me.\\\" In spite of the \\\"suave delivery and the song's inherent tunefulness\\\", the object of Ocean's affection soon ditches his love songs in favor of those sung \\\"by real R&B big-shots (Drake included)\\\".The mixtape also contains several references to American director Stanley Kubrick and his films, most notably Eyes Wide Shut. Nicole Kidman's adulterous soliloquy from the film can be heard during the song \\\"Lovecrimes\\\", adding a sense of manic dread.\\\" The film is also referenced on the track \\\"Novacane\\\", where Ocean also sings that he's \\\"feelin like Stanley Kubrick\\\". Following that is the track \\\"There Will Be Tears\\\". The song has been described as emotional in nature, containing a glitchy beat sampled from Mr Hudson, with heavily synthesised vocals. \\\"There Will Be Tears\\\" has a thundering bass flat over a hyperactive 808 beat. Ocean sings about not having a father; \\\"Hide my face, hide my face, can't let 'em see me crying / Cause these boys didn't have no fathers neither / And they weren't crying\\\", where he \\\"lets his guard down completely.\\\"\\\"Swim Good\\\" has been called an \\\"astonishing suicide song\\\" and that Ocean finds himself dressed in black ('Like I'm ready for a funeral'), tormented by heartbreak and on the verge of driving his car into the sea. The song is a grim escape fantasy describing a murder suicide, which \\\"has the singer driving his car to the shore, his trunk 'bleeding' with 'broken hearts'.\\\" The hook of the song ends with the refrain of \\\"I feel like a ghost, no Swayze, ever since I lost my baby.\\\" \\\"Dust\\\" uses books as an extended metaphor for memories and experience, with lines like \\\"so many pages I wrote, wish I could revise 'em / But there's no erasing\\\".The penultimate track is \\\"American Wedding\\\", a 7-minute remake of \\\"Hotel California\\\" by American rock band Eagles. The track expresses an extended tale of a shotgun marriage and subsequent divorce. Its here that we \\\"might get a little peek into the psychology of the man shirking the foremost genre for love songs: He doesn't believe in love. At least not in the United States.\\\" The song has a \\\"totally unexpected ending for a song told as a flashback.\\\" The album ends with \\\"Nature Feels\\\", a reinterpretation of MGMT's \\\"Electric Feel\\\". The song exhibits Ocean as an \\\"openly fun character\\\", opening the song with the line \\\"I've been meaning to fuck you in the garden.\\\" According to Pitchfork, no matter the mood, Ocean is always \\\"quick to add fine particulars that make his songs his songs\\\". Pitchfork called \\\"Nature Feel\\\" an \\\"MGMT-sampling Garden of Eden fuck ode\\\".\\n\\n\\n== Critical reception ==\\nNostalgia, Ultra received widespread acclaim from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the mixtape received an average score of 83, based on nine reviews. Anupa Mistry from Exclaim! called it \\\"sophisticated\\\", \\\"pulsing and expansive\\\", and wrote that Ocean's \\\"alt sensibilities\\\" prove \\\"musically intuitive\\\" AllMusic's Andy Kellman felt that Ocean's uniqueness lies in his \\\"wistful, often self-effacing perspective and numbed, restrained delivery\\\" rather than his production choices, which he found \\\"neither exceptional nor particularly left of center\\\". AbsolutePunk praised the beats as \\\"unique, well-executed originals\\\" and commented that songs such as \\\"Swim Good\\\" and \\\"Strawberry Swing\\\" show that \\\"Ocean's voice is as great as his knack for writing thoughtful pop songs.\\\" Steven Hyden of The A.V. Club called the mixtape \\\"dark, playful, a little tasteless, and absolutely riveting\\\". Connor O'Neill of The Miscellany News wrote that, \\\"by funneling [the primary means of R&B decadence] through his diverse and diverging palette, Ocean literalizes both his nostalgic impulses and the odd future of which he is a part.\\\" The Village Voice's Sean Fennessey called him \\\"an intuitive r&b stylist, with a firm sense of song structure.\\\" Rudy K. of Sputnikmusic felt that the mixtape sounds \\\"so fresh, so real\\\" for a member from Odd Future and stated, \\\"With Ocean, it never sounds contrived.\\\"In his review for MSN Music, Robert Christgau described Ocean's \\\"romantic laments\\\" as \\\"models of texture, respect, and profound loss, their beats subtle, seductive, weird, and seized like time whether he's deploying 'songs for women' that are soon trumped by Drake's, not feeling a porn-moonlighting dental student and her 'novacaine,' or annulling a courthouse wedding solemnized just before his bride turned in her term paper on hijab.\\\" Pitchfork Media's Ryan Dombal commented that \\\"There are distinct elements of Drake's melancholic paranoia and The-Dream's high melodrama, too. But there's also a heady surreality surrounding Nostalgia, Ultra that makes it unique.\\\" Jon Caramanica of The New York Times called it \\\"slick and intuitive ... full of astral soul that owes debts to Terence Trent D'Arby, Pharrell Williams, even Drake\\\", adding that \\\"[Ocean] sings casually but precisely, stretching out syllables as if he's forgetting to let them go.\\\" NPR's Andrew Noz commented that \\\"It's his songwriting, smart and subtle, that sets Ocean far apart from that pack\\\", adding that \\\"The finest moments of Nostalgia, Ultra orbit the same soul-baring and minutiae-obsessed space as Marvin Gaye's breakup opus Here, My Dear or any number of Prince's more idiosyncratic ballads\\\". No Ripcord's Charlie Jebb wrote that \\\"Nostalgia, Ultra has more than enough good stuff to establish Ocean as an artist to watch,\\\" calling it \\\"[an] R&B record with crossover potential without sacrificing soul that creates a complete picture of its author, warts and all.\\\"\\n\\n\\n== Planned reissue ==\\nOn May 19, 2011, Ocean's record label Def Jam announced its plans to release an EP containing tracks from nostalgia, ULTRA. Ocean announced that the re-release would have been titled Nostalgia, Lite and that it was expected to feature seven tracks. The EP was originally scheduled to be released on July 26, 2011, however, Ocean noted on his official Tumblr page on July 24, 2011 that Nostalgia, Lite would no longer be released on July 26 and that the project was cancelled. Both \\\"Swim Good\\\" and \\\"Novacane\\\" were set to be featured on the release. Talking about which other songs would make it onto the reissue, Ocean commented that \\\"The Eagles sample 'American Wedding' has no chance in hell of being cleared\\\". He continued, \\\"Coldplay sample 'Strawberry Swing', possibly. I hear 'possibly' from people who say they know. MGMT, those guys seem chill. I heard they heard the record 'Nature Feels' and they liked it a lot, so hopefully that can go someway.\\\" Other tracks on the reissue were set to be \\\"Acura Integurl\\\", which appeared on the unofficial release The Lonny Breaux Collection, and \\\"Whip Appeal\\\" which was released in 2012. In 2012, Ocean commented again on his blog that \\\"Nostalgia Lite is \\\"never coming out.\\\"\\n\\n\\n== Singles ==\\n\\\"Novacane\\\" was officially released as the first single from Nostalgia, Ultra on May 31, 2011. \\\"Novacane\\\" first charted on the US Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs on May 11, 2011 at number 65. The subsequent week, it rose to number 58, and on its third week, the single rose to number 52. In its fourth week, it rose to number 17. The music video for \\\"Novacane\\\" was released on June 16, directed by Australian director Nabil Elderkin. When discussing the video, Ocean commented \\\"I was just trying to connect or articulate visually the feeling of being numb. The feeling of wanting to feel something you can't feel. A lot of things can cause that numbing, but in the video it was some sort of topical aesthetic and a little bit of special effects.\\\" The song also charted on the Billboard Hot 100 at position 82 and at 6 on the Billboard Heatseekers Songs.\\\"Swim Good\\\" was released as the second single from the mixtape on October 18, 2011, and the song charted at position 70 on the Billboard R&B chart for three weeks. It entered the top 40 in Belgium. The music video (directed by Nabil Elderkin) was released via Ocean's tumblr account on September 16. Ocean performed \\\"Novacane\\\" and \\\"She\\\" with Tyler, The Creator at an Odd Future performance in New York City. During Odd Future 2012's tour promoting The Odd Future Tape Vol. 2, Frank performed with the group.\\n\\n\\n== Tour ==\\n\\nOcean embarked on a six-date concert tour from November 5 to November 15, 2011, through North America and Europe to promote both the mixtape and his other musical projects. Originally, six shows were scheduled with a New York City performance at the Bowery Ballroom on the 6th. The original date for that show was postponed to the 27th, and that an additional show on the 28th had been added. The reported reason was because Ocean was sick. The performances featured no opening act, and the only performer on stage at any given time was Ocean.Rolling Stone reviewed the debut show, calling Ocean awkward at times, though they stated that \\\"fortunately his dispassionately told stories of love and loss in a world that assumes impermanence could handle the load of the audience.\\\" MTV commented that it took Ocean \\\"some time to warm up to the crowd\\\" at his debut New Orleans performance, though they noted the performance started the tour to a \\\"promising start\\\". MTV later reviewed the New York performance on the 27th and called Ocean \\\"an audience charmer\\\". The New York Times critic Jon Caramanica gave a positive review to the same New York performance, calling Ocean a \\\"versatile singer\\\" and writing that \\\"in his elegant, savvy, slightly crooked postsoul, he shifts sneakily between the two topics, singing about love as a byproduct of music and using the subject of music to dig deep about love.\\\"The set lists to the various shows varied, though singles \\\"Swim Good\\\" and \\\"Novacane\\\" were performed at all shows. Others tracks like \\\"LoveCrimes\\\", \\\"Dust\\\" and \\\"American Wedding\\\" were performed at a majority of the shows, and \\\"Strawberry Swing\\\" \\\"We All Try\\\" were performed four times each. Portions of \\\"No Church in the Wild\\\" and \\\"Made in America\\\", along with \\\"I Miss You\\\" and \\\"Thinkin Bout You\\\" were also performed. The performances of \\\"American Wedding\\\" were accompanied by comedic moments where Ocean played Guitar Hero. Ocean performed at the April 2012 Coachella Musical Festival.\\n\\n\\n== Impact ==\\n\\nBefore the release of Nostalgia, Ultra, Ocean was a relatively unknown artist who made a majority of his money from ghostwriting. Within six months, it was noted that Ocean had become the \\\"go-to vocal hook man.\\\" The release of the mixtape interested rap recording artist and producer Kanye West, who was reported to be a big fan. West invited Ocean to write and sing on two songs off Watch the Throne, a collaborative record with rapper Jay-Z. Frank wrote and provided vocals on tracks \\\"No Church in the Wild\\\" and \\\"Made in America\\\". Singer Beyonce Knowles heard of the mixtape through her husband Jay-Z and was a fan of it. She subsequently invited Ocean to co-write \\\"I Miss You\\\" for her album 4. Discussing how she first heard of Ocean and Nostalgia, Ultra, she commented; \\\"Jay-Z had a CD playing in the car one Sunday when we were driving to Brooklyn. I noticed his tone, his arrangements, and his storytelling. I immediately reached out to him--literally the next morning. I asked him to fly to New York and work on my record.West also offered to appear on Ocean's debut album, but Ocean refused, saying \\\"as much as I want to work with you... I kind of want to do this without you. I kind of want to do it on my own.\\\" Rapper Nas was also a fan of the mixtape, writing that \\\"He's new, he's fresh. He doesn't sound fly-by-night. The moment you hear it -- I hear what he's sayin', and I relate.\\\" Nas also stated on Twitter that he and Ocean were collaborating on a song from Nas's tenth studio album Life Is Good, though the material never made the album. Chicago born rapper Lupe Fiasco expressed a positive opinion of the release too.Ocean quickly became Odd Future's main singing highlight, providing vocal hooks on Odd Future albums like BlackenedWhite, Goblin, and The Odd Future Tape Vol. 2. Ocean toured with the group on several occasions and made appearances during their shows. On January 5, 2012, the BBC announced that Ocean had finished in second place of the BBC's Sound of 2012 poll. In addition, MTV described the mixtape as a \\\"cult classic\\\". On August 2, 2012, the music video for \\\"Swim Good\\\" was nominated for three MTV Video Music Awards: Best Direction and Best Male Video, with Ocean being nominated for Best New Artist for his work with the video.\\n\\n\\n== Accolades ==\\nThe record was nominated for Best International Album at the 2012 Swedish Grammis Awards. Despite being a mixtape, Nostalgia, Ultra was featured on several music critics' and publications' end-of-year albums lists. Pitchfork Media put it number 35 on its list of the year's top albums, writing that \\\"Chris Breaux, who goes by Frank Ocean, is a male R&B singer with male R&B contradictions: As much as he wants to listen to his heart, he can't completely ignore his dick.\\\" The Guardian writer Tim Jonze named it the year's third best album, musing \\\"unafraid to tackle suicide, abortion and absent fathers, this free mixtape introduced one of our most refreshing new R&B stars.\\\" The A.V. Club ranked the album number 15 on its year-end list, commenting that \\\"Nostalgia, Ultra became a runaway Internet hit that showed off Ocean's coaxing croon as well as his outre songwriting skills. Sweetly romantic, yet pensive and moody, Nostalgia is an R&B record for manics, from the hazy lament of 'Novacane' to the inward-looking contradiction of 'Songs For Women' to the clever pop remakes of The Eagles' 'Hotel California' and Coldplay's 'Strawberry Swing'.\\\"Rolling Stone named it the 24th best album of the year, writing \\\"the debut mixtape from the 24-year-old singer (and Odd Future member) is an avant-R&B killer.\\\" Complex named it the fourth best album of the year and the second best mixtape. Time named it the fifth best album of the year, and wrote that \\\"Ocean also weaves audio of a tape recorder in rewind, video games and Nicole Kidman's adulterous monologue from Eyes Wide Shut into his songs to give the album a personal feel -- as if Ocean were gifting us with a collection of sounds that he finds emotionally meaningful.\\\" Spin named it the 41st best album of the year while Mojo placed the album at number 49. Robert Christgau named it the fourth best album of the year in his Pazz & Jop dean's list.The track \\\"Novacane\\\" also received widespread critical acclaim. It was listed as one of the best songs of the year by The New York Times, Ology, Spin, Zimbio, and Pitchfork Media named both the video and the song as amongst the best of the year.\\n\\n\\n== Controversy ==\\n\\nIn March 2012, controversy arose over the track \\\"American Wedding\\\", which samples The Eagles' song \\\"Hotel California\\\". Don Henley of the Eagles \\\"had threatened legal action over Ocean's track\\\", claiming that Ocean's version of the song was illegal. The track was widely removed from the internet following this controversy, being removed from music sharing sites such as YouTube. A spokesman for the band announced that a lawsuit would be filed against Ocean if performed the song live.\\n\\n\\\"Frank Ocean did not merely 'sample' a portion of the Eagles' Hotel California; he took the whole master track, plus the song's existing melody, and replaced the lyrics with his own. This is not creative, let alone 'intimidating.' It's illegal. For the record, Don Henley has not threatened or instituted any legal action against Frank Ocean, although the Eagles are now considering whether they should.\\\"\\n\\nSeveral publications noted that the song was released for free on a non-profitable mixtape, and that \\\"live covers of famous songs are common in live performances\\\", and that sampling is a common practice on mixtapes. Ocean responded to the controversy via his Tumblr account:\\n\\n\\\"He (They) threatened to sue if I perform it again. I think that's fuckin awesome. I guess if I play it at Coachella it'll cost me a couple hundred racks. If I don't show up to court, it'll be a judgement against me & will probably show up on my credit report. Oh well. I try to buy my shit cash anyway. They asked that I release a statement expressing my admiration for Mr. Henley, along with my assistance pulling it off the web as much as possible. Shit's weird. Ain't this guy rich as fuck? Why sue the new guy? I didn't make a dime off that song. I released it for free. If anything I'm paying homage.\\\"\\n\\nOcean performed the song live occasionally with an altered arrangement not utilizing the original \\\"Hotel California\\\" sample.\\nHenley eventually spoke out on the controversy, defending his stance on the 2012 litigation threat and referring to Ocean as \\\"talentless\\\".\\n\\n\\n== Track listing ==\\nSample credits\\\"Street Fighter\\\" contains samples of \\\"Lovers in Japan\\\" and \\\"Life in Technicolor\\\" performed by Coldplay.\\n\\\"Strawberry Swing\\\" contains samples of the song of the same name performed by Coldplay.\\n\\\"Bitches Talkin'\\\" contains samples of \\\"Optimistic\\\" performed by Radiohead.\\n\\\"Lovecrimes\\\" contains dialogue excerpts from the film \\\"Eyes Wide Shut\\\".\\n\\\"Goldeneye\\\" contains samples of \\\"Central Park\\\" and \\\"Everything Is Broken\\\" performed by Mr Hudson.\\n\\\"There Will Be Tears\\\" contains samples of the song of the same name performed by Mr Hudson.\\n\\\"Swim Good\\\" contains additional background vocals by Tyler, The Creator.\\n\\\"American Wedding\\\" contains samples of \\\"Hotel California\\\" performed by Eagles.\\n\\\"Soul Calibur\\\" contains samples of \\\"4th Dimensional Transition\\\" and \\\"Kids\\\", performed by MGMT.\\n\\\"Nature Feels\\\" contains samples from \\\"Electric Feel\\\" performed by MGMT, and uncredited background vocals by Brandy and Rich King.\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nNostalgia, Ultra at Discogs (list of releases)\\nFrank Ocean's blog at Tumblr\\nInterview at RESPECT.\", \"rev_id\": 854642241, \"accessed\": \"2018-09-03 00:23:59.864295\", \"links\": [\"New York City\", \"Novacane (song)\", \"Street Fighter\", \"Strawberry Swing\", \"Mojo (magazine)\", \"Terence Trent D'Arby\", \"AbsolutePunk\", \"Domo Genesis\", \"Made in America (Jay-Z and Kanye West song)\", \"Drake (entertainer)\", \"The A.V.

Another example is that each hemisphere in the brain tends to represent one side of the body. In the cerebellum this is the same bodyside, but in the forebrain this is predominantly the contralateral side.\\n\\n\\n== Lateralized functions ==\\n\\n\\n=== Language ===\\nLanguage functions such as grammar, vocabulary and literal meaning are typically lateralized to the left hemisphere, especially in right handed individuals. While language production is left-lateralized in up to 90% of right-handers, it is more bilateral, or even right-lateralized, in approximately 50% of left-handers.Broca's area and Wernicke's area, two areas associated with the production of speech, are located in the left cerebral hemisphere for about 95% of right-handers, but about 70% of left-handers.\\n\\n\\n=== Auditory and visual processing ===\\nThe processing of visual and auditory stimuli, spatial manipulation, facial perception, and artistic ability are represented bilaterally. Numerical estimation, comparison and online calculation depend on bilateral parietal regions while exact calculation and fact retrieval are associated with left parietal regions, perhaps due to their ties to linguistic processing.\\n\\n\\n== Clinical significance ==\\nDepression is linked with a hyperactive right hemisphere, with evidence of selective involvement in \\\"processing negative emotions, pessimistic thoughts and unconstructive thinking styles\\\", as well as vigilance, arousal and self-reflection, and a relatively hypoactive left hemisphere, \\\"specifically involved in processing pleasurable experiences\\\" and \\\"relatively more involved in decision-making processes\\\". Additionally, \\\"left hemisphere lesions result in an omissive response bias or error pattern whereas right hemisphere lesions result in a commissive response bias or error pattern.\\\" The delusional misidentification syndromes, reduplicative paramnesia and Capgras delusion are also often the result of right hemisphere lesions.\\n\\n\\n=== Hemisphere damage ===\\nDamage to either the right or left hemisphere, and its resulting deficits provide insight into the function of the damaged area. Right hemisphere damage has many effects on language production and perception. Damage or lesions to the right hemisphere can result in a lack of emotional prosody or intonation when speaking. Right hemisphere damage also has monumental effects on understanding discourse. People with damage to the right hemisphere have a reduced ability to generate inferences, comprehend and produce main concepts and a reduced ability to manage alternative meanings. Furthermore, when engaging in discourse people with right hemisphere damage, their discourse is often abrupt and perfunctory or verbose and excessive. They can also have pragmatic deficits in situations of turn taking, topic maintenance and shared knowledge.Lateral brain damage can also have effects on spatial frequency. People with left hemisphere damage are only able to see low frequency, or big picture, parts of an image. Right hemisphere damage causes damage to low spatial frequency, so people with right hemisphere damage can only see the details of an image, or the high frequency parts of an image.\\n\\n\\n=== Plasticity ===\\nIf a specific region of the brain, or even an entire hemisphere, is injured or destroyed, its functions can sometimes be assumed by a neighboring region in the same hemisphere or the corresponding region in the other hemisphere, depending upon the area damaged and the patient's age. When injury interferes with pathways from one area to another, alternative (indirect) connections may develop to communicate information with detached areas, despite the inefficiencies.\\n\\n\\n=== Broca's aphasia ===\\nBroca's aphasia is a specific type of expressive aphasia and is so named due to the aphasia that results from damage or lesions to the Broca's area of the brain, that exists most commonly in the left inferior frontal hemisphere. Thus, the aphasia that develops from the lack of functioning of the Broca's area is an expressive and non-fluent aphasia. It is called 'non-fluent' due the issues that arise because Broca's area is critical for language pronunciation and production. The area controls some motor aspects of speech production and articulation of thoughts to words and as such lesions to the area result in the specific non-fluent aphasia.\\n\\n\\n=== Wernicke's aphasia ===\\nWernicke's aphasia is the result of damage to the area of the brain that is commonly in the left hemisphere above the sylvian fissure. Damage to this area causes primarily a deficit in language comprehension.  While the ability to speak fluently with normal melodic intonation is spared, the language produced by a person with Wernicke's aphasia is riddled with semantic errors, and may sound nonsensical to the listener. Wernicke's aphasia is characterized by phonemic paraphasias, neologism or jargon. Another characteristic of a person with Wernicke's aphasia is that they are unconcerned by the mistakes that they are making.\\n\\n\\n== Society and culture ==\\n\\n\\n=== Misapplication ===\\nTerence Hines states that the research on brain lateralization is valid as a research program, though commercial promoters have applied it to promote subjects and products far outside the implications of the research. For example, the implications of the research have no bearing on psychological interventions such as EMDR and neurolinguistic programming, brain-training equipment, or management training.\\n\\n\\n=== Pop psychology ===\\n\\nSome popularizations oversimplify the science about lateralization, by presenting the functional differences between hemispheres as being more absolute than is actually the case.\\n\\n\\n=== Sex differences ===\\n\\nIn the 19th century and to a lesser extent the 20th, it was thought that each side of the brain was associated with a specific gender: the left corresponding with masculinity and the right with femininity and each half could function independently. The right side of the brain was seen as the inferior and thought to be prominent in women, savages, children, criminals, and the insane. A prime example of this in fictional literature can be seen in Robert Louis Stevenson's Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.\\n\\n\\n== Evolutionary advantage ==\\nThe widespread lateralization of many vertebrate animals indicates an evolutionary advantage associated with the specialization of each hemisphere.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\n\\n=== Broca ===\\nOne of the first indications of brain function lateralization resulted from the research of French physician Pierre Paul Broca, in 1861. His research involved the male patient nicknamed \\\"Tan\\\", who suffered a speech deficit (aphasia); \\\"tan\\\" was one of the few words he could articulate, hence his nickname. In Tan's autopsy, Broca determined he had a syphilitic lesion in the left cerebral hemisphere. This left frontal lobe brain area (Broca's area) is an important speech production region. The motor aspects of speech production deficits caused by damage to Broca's area are known as expressive aphasia. In clinical assessment of this aphasia, it is noted that the patient cannot clearly articulate the language being employed.\\n\\n\\n=== Wernicke ===\\nGerman physician Karl Wernicke continued in the vein of Broca's research by studying language deficits unlike expressive aphasia. Wernicke noted that not every deficit was in speech production; some were linguistic. He found that damage to the left posterior, superior temporal gyrus (Wernicke's area) caused language comprehension deficits rather than speech production deficits, a syndrome known as receptive aphasia.\\n\\n\\n=== Imaging ===\\nThese seminal works on hemispheric specialization were done on patients or postmortem brains, raising questions about the potential impact of pathology on the research findings.  New methods permit the in vivo comparison of the hemispheres in healthy subjects.  Particularly, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) are important because of their high spatial resolution and ability to image subcortical brain structures.\\n\\n\\n=== Movement and sensation ===\\nIn the 1940s, neurosurgeon Wilder Penfield and his neurologist colleague Herbert Jasper developed a technique of brain mapping to help reduce side effects caused by surgery to treat epilepsy.  They stimulated motor and somatosensory cortices of the brain with small electrical currents to activate discrete brain regions.  They found that stimulation of one hemisphere's motor cortex produces muscle contraction on the opposite side of the body.  Furthermore, the functional map of the motor and sensory cortices is fairly consistent from person to person; Penfield and Jasper's famous pictures of the motor and sensory homunculi were the result.\\n\\n\\n=== Split-brain patients ===\\n\\nResearch by Michael Gazzaniga and Roger Wolcott Sperry in the 1960s on split-brain patients led to an even greater understanding of functional laterality. Split-brain patients are patients who have undergone corpus callosotomy (usually as a treatment for severe epilepsy), a severing of a large part of the corpus callosum. The corpus callosum connects the two hemispheres of the brain and allows them to communicate. When these connections are cut, the two halves of the brain have a reduced capacity to communicate with each other. This led to many interesting behavioral phenomena that allowed Gazzaniga and Sperry to study the contributions of each hemisphere to various cognitive and perceptual processes. One of their main findings was that the right hemisphere was capable of rudimentary language processing, but often has no lexical or grammatical abilities. Eran Zaidel also studied such patients and found some evidence for the right hemisphere having at least some syntactic ability.\\nLanguage is primarily localized in the left hemisphere. One of the experiments carried out by Gazzaniga involved a split-brain male patient sitting in front of a computer screen while having words and images presented on either side of the screen and the visual stimuli would go to either the right or left visual field, and thus the left or right brain, respectively. It was observed that if the patient was presented with an image to his left visual field (right brain), he would report not seeing anything. If he was able to feel around for certain objects, he could accurately pick out the correct object, despite not having the ability to verbalize what he saw. This led to confirmation that the left brain is localized for language whereas the right brain does not have this capability, and when the corpus callosum is cut, the two hemispheres cannot communicate in order for situation-pertinent speech to be produced.\\n\\n\\n== Additional images ==\\n\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== Further reading ==\", \"rev_id\": 856718662, \"accessed\": \"2018-09-03 00:23:59.864295\", \"links\": [\"Robert Louis Stevenson\", \"Michael Gazzaniga\", \"Herbert Jasper\", \"Roger Wolcott Sperry\", \"Wernicke's area\", \"Pierre Paul Broca\", \"Terence Hines\", \"Wilder Penfield\", \"Karl Wernicke\", \"Language\", \"EMDR\", \"Split-brain\", \"Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\", \"Capgras delusion\", \"Broca's area\"]}, {\"title\": \"She\", \"link_id\": \"She (Tyler, the Creator song)\", \"summary\": \"\\\"She\\\" is a song by American hip hop artist and OFWGKTA member Tyler, the Creator from his album Goblin.

The track is \\\"delivered with sweetly juvenile expressions of desire, except that Tyler peppers the track with a single-word epithet that would earn him a kick in the groin from any self-respecting woman.\\\" HipHopDX's Sean Ryon mused that \\\"even the more subdued songs like \\\"She\\\" with Frank Ocean\\\" embody \\\"Tyler's middle-fingers-up attitude, as he twists perverted tales of stalking girls and \\\"stabbing Bruno Mars in his goddamn esophagus\\\" into anathematic odes to unbridled individualism.\\\"Though it was noted that even \\\"She\\\" has \\\"passing moments of lyrical humanity to go with the pliant music (\\\"When I'm with my friends I just put on a front / But in the back of my top I'm writing songs about 'we'\\\").

While \\\"She\\\" tends to get lost in the midst of heavier tracks like \\\"Yonkers\\\" and \\\"Transylvania,\\\" it deserves a ton of recognition for leaning a bit more towards a mainstream sound Odd Future isn't known for while staying true to their original vision.\\\"NME's Louis Pattison described the track as a  \\\"curdled take on silky '70s rare groove legend Roy Ayers\\\" and stated that it was \\\"actually rather gorgeous\\\". Tiny Mix Tapes commented however that Tyler's \\\"flow is painful to listen to on slower tracks such as \\\"She\\\" though [it] was saved by his ambition [in] production\\\". Max Feldman of PopMatters noted that Tyler \\\"also does a lot of thinking through the medium of his own genitals, as evidenced on lusty R&B crooner \\\"She\\\" where he lets his perverse side free.\\\"\\n\\n\\n== Promotion ==\\n\\nThe music video for \\\"She\\\" was shot in Los Angeles. Ocean posted several behind the scene photos of the video shoot onto his own personal Tumblr account, including pictures \\\"with a pretty young thing as his leading lady.\\\" Ocean plays \\\"double duty as a cop and the man of the house, almost unrecognizable in a white wig and drab attire.

The company grew for the next several years, acquiring other brands such as the Columbia Phonograph Company, including its Okeh Records subsidiary, in 1934.\\n\\n\\n=== 1938-1970: Columbia/CBS Records ===\\nIn 1938, ARC was acquired by the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) under the guidance of chief executive William S. Paley. The company was later renamed Columbia Recording Corporation, and changed again to Columbia Records Inc. in 1947. Edward Wallerstein, who served as the head of Columbia Records since the late 1930's, helped establish the company as a leader in the record industry by spearheading the successful introduction of the LP record. Columbia's success continued through the 1950's with the launch of Epic Records in 1953 and Date Records in 1958. By 1962, the Columbia Records productions unit was operating four plants around the United States located in Los Angeles, California; Terre Haute, Indiana; Bridgeport, Connecticut; and Pitman, New Jersey.Columbia's international arm was launched in 1962 under the name \\\"CBS Records,\\\" as the company only owned the rights to the Columbia name in North America. In 1964, the company began acquiring record companies in other countries for its CBS Records International unit and established its own UK distribution outfit with the acquisition of Oriole Records.By 1966, Columbia was renamed as CBS Records and was a separate unit of parent company, CBS-Columbia Group. In March 1968, CBS and Sony formed CBS/Sony Records, a Japanese business joint venture.\\n\\n\\n=== 1971-1991: CBS Records Group ===\\nIn 1971, CBS Records was expanded into its own \\\"CBS Records Group\\\", with Clive Davis as its administrative vice president and general manager. In the 1980s to the early 1990s, the company managed several successful labels, including CBS Associated Records, which signed artists including Ozzy Osbourne, the Fabulous Thunderbirds, Electric Light Orchestra, Joan Jett, and Henry Lee Summer. By 1987, CBS was the only \\\"big three\\\" American TV network to have a co-owned record company. With Sony being one of the developers behind the compact disc digital music media, a compact disc production plant was constructed in Japan under the joint venture, allowing CBS to begin supplying some of the first compact disc releases for the American market in 1983.On November 17, 1987, Sony acquired CBS Records for US$2 billion. CBS Inc., now CBS Corporation, retained the rights to the CBS name for music recordings but granted Sony a temporary license to use the CBS name. The sale was completed on January 5, 1988. CBS Corporation founded a new CBS Records in 2006, which was distributed by Sony through its RED subsidiary.\\n\\n\\n=== 1991-2004: Birth of Sony Music Entertainment ===\\nSony renamed the record company Sony Music Entertainment (SME) on January 1, 1991, fulfilling the terms set under the 1988 buyout, which granted only a transitional license to the CBS trademark. The CBS Associated label was renamed Epic Associated. Also on January 1, 1991, to replace the CBS label, Sony reintroduced the Columbia label worldwide, which it previously held in the United States and Canada only, after it acquired the international rights to the trademark from EMI in 1990. Japan is the only country where Sony does not have rights to the Columbia name as it is controlled by Nippon Columbia, an unrelated company. Thus, Sony Music Entertainment Japan issues labels under Sony Records. The Columbia Records trademark's rightsholder in Spain was Bertelsmann Music Group, Germany, which Sony Music subsequently subsumed via a 2004 merger, and a subsequent 2008 buyout.In 1995, Sony and Michael Jackson formed a joint venture which merged Sony's music publishing operations with Jackson's ATV Music to form Sony/ATV Music Publishing.\\n\\n\\n=== 2004-2008: Sony BMG: Joint venture with Bertelsmann ===\\n\\nIn August 2004, Sony entered joint venture with equal partner Bertelsmann, by merging Sony Music and Bertelsmann Music Group, Germany, to establish Sony BMG Music Entertainment. However Sony continued to operate its Japanese music business independently from Sony BMG while BMG Japan was made part of the merger.The merger made Columbia and Epic sister labels to RCA Records, which was once owned by CBS rival, NBC. It also started the process of bringing BMG's Arista Records back under common ownership with its former parent Columbia Pictures, a Sony division since 1989, and also brought Arista founder Clive Davis back into the fold. As of 2017, Davis was still with Sony Music as chief creative officer.\\n\\n\\n=== 2008-present: Sony Music Entertainment and restructuring ===\\nOn August 5, 2008, Sony Corporation of America (SCA) and Bertelsmann announced that Sony had agreed to acquire Bertelsmann's 50% stake in Sony BMG. The company completed the acquisition on October 1, 2008. On July 1, 2009, SME and IODA announced a strategic partnership to leverage worldwide online retail distribution networks and complementary technologies to support independent labels and music rights holders. In March 2010, Sony Corp partnered with The Michael Jackson Company in a contract of more than $250 million, the largest deal in recorded music history.Doug Morris, who was head of Warner Music Group, and later Universal Music, became chairman and CEO of Sony Music Entertainment on July 1, 2011. Sony Music underwent restructuring upon Morris' arrival; with some artists switching labels while other labels were shut down altogether. In June 2012, a consortium led by Sony/ATV acquired EMI Music Publishing, making Sony/ATV the world's largest music publisher at the time.Sony experienced a number of changes with its international labels in subsequent years. In March 2012, Sony Music reportedly closed its Philippines office due to piracy, causing it to move distribution of SME in the Philippines to Ivory Music. In July 2013, Sony Music withdrew from the Greek market due to an economic crisis. Albums released by Sony Music in Greece from domestic and foreign artists would then be carried by Feelgood Records.In June 2017, Sony announced that by March 2018 it would be producing vinyl records in-house for the first time since ceasing their production in 1989. Reporting the decision, the BBC noted that, \\\"Sony's move comes a few months after it equipped its Tokyo studio with a cutting lathe, used to produce the master discs needed for manufacturing vinyl records\\\" but added that \\\"Sony is even struggling to find older engineers who know how to make records\\\".\\n\\n\\n==== Unties ====\\n\\nSony Music Entertainment announced the launch of its first video game publishing label, Unties, in October 2017. Unties will publish indie games for the PlayStation 4, PlayStation VR, Nintendo Switch, and PC. The name was selected by Sony as representative of helping to \\\"unleash\\\" the power of independent video game development and \\\"unshackle\\\" such developers from the traditional video game publishing process.\\n\\n\\n== Sony Music UK ==\\nSony Music UK is owned and operated by Sony Music Entertainment in the United Kingdom. Since 2014, Jason Iley has been Chairman and CEO of Sony Music UK. Though owned by Sony Music Entertainment, Sony Music UK has standalone operations in the UK to promote musicians within the UK.Iley was recently named as one of Billboard's (magazine) 53 International Power Players in the music industry. In June 2017, it was announced that Sony would be merging it's two independent distribution companies The Orchard and Red Essential.2014 saw Sony's best singles success for 33 years, with 11 number 1 singles. Sony Music artists won a total of five individual awards at the BRITs 2015, including Best Female Solo Artist for Paloma Faith and Mark Ronson's 'Uptown Funk', which picked up Best British Single. Several other of the label's artists - Foo Fighters, One Direction and Pharrell Williams - also collected awards.Sony's performance at the BRITs 2015 was the label's best in nearly 20 years, winning a total of 5 awards. In 2017, Sony Music UK celebrated the most successful BRIT Awards in the company's history, winning seven of the 11 awards.\\nJason Iley, Chairman and CEO, Sony Music UK and Ireland, said: \\\"This is a truly momentous and historic night for Sony Music's artists - and is just reward for so many people's dedication and hard work. I would like to congratulate and pay tribute to all of our artists from around the world. Everyone at Sony Music is proud and humbled every day to work alongside people with such exceptional creativity, drive, and musicianship. I would also like to thank all the brilliant people at Sony Music, whose passion and determination has helped deliver the artists' vision.\\\"\\nIn the last three years, Sony Music UK has made key acquisitions including forming Insanity Records with Insanity Management. Craig David became the first artist to sign an album deal with Insanity Records. Sony Music UK signed Robbie Williams, who released his 11th album The Heavy Entertainment in 2016. Jason Iley commented that the agreement was \\\"a once in a lifetime signing with the biggest male solo artist of our generation.\\\" Sony Music UK also incorporated the independent sales and distribution company Essential Music and Marketing - renamed to Red Essential. In August 2016 Sony Music acquired Ministry of Sound Recordings, home to London Grammar, DJ Fresh and Sigala.On April 5, 2017, two of Sony Music UK's labels won awards at the annual Music Week Awards. Columbia Records received the 'A&R of the Year' Award, while Syco were awarded the 'Record Company of the Year' Award.On November 6, 2017, Sony Music CEO Rob Stringer was feted with the Music Industry Trusts Award at a star-studded gala in London.\\n\\n\\n== Controversy ==\\n\\n\\n=== CD price fixing ===\\n\\nBetween 1995 and 2000, music companies were found to have used illegal marketing agreements such as minimum advertised pricing to artificially inflate prices of compact discs. This was done in order to end price wars of the early 1990s among discounters such as Best Buy and Target. A settlement was reached in 2002 that included music publishers and distributors Sony Music, Warner Music, Bertelsmann Music Group, EMI Music and Universal Music. In restitution for price fixing, they agreed to pay a $67.4 million fine and distribute $75.7 million in CDs to public and non-profit groups but admitted no wrongdoing. It is estimated that customers were overcharged by nearly $500 million overall and up to $5 per album.\\n\\n\\n=== Michael Jackson ===\\nThe release of Invincible was preceded by a dispute between Michael Jackson and Sony Music Entertainment. Jackson had expected the licenses to the masters of his albums to revert to him sometime in the early 2000s, after which he would be able to promote the material however he pleased and keep the profits; however, clauses in the contract set the revert date years into the future. Jackson discovered that the attorney who had represented him in the deal had also been representing Sony. He was also concerned that for years Sony had been pressuring him to sell his share in its music catalog venture; he feared that Sony might have had a conflict of interest, since if Jackson's career failed, he would have had to sell his share of the catalog at a low price. Jackson sought an early exit from his contract.In July 2002 Jackson alleged that the then-Sony Music chairman Tommy Mottola was a \\\"devil\\\" and \\\"racist\\\" who did not support his African-American artists, using them merely for his own gain. He charged that Mottola had called his colleague Irv Gotti a \\\"fat nigger\\\". Sony refused to renew Jackson's contract, and claimed that a $25 million promotional campaign had failed because Jackson refused to tour in the United States.\\n\\n\\n=== Prosecution of copyright infringement ===\\nIn May 2012, Sony Music filed charges against the website IsoHunt. The plaintiff's claims in the court document filed at the Supreme Court of British Columbia read: \\\"The IsoHunt Websites have been designed and are operated by the defendants with the sole purpose of profiting from rampant copyright infringement which defendants actively encourage, promote, authorize, induce, aid, abet, materially contribute to and commercially profit from.\\\" On February 2016, in a lawsuit filed at a California federal court, Sony Music Entertainment and its associated brands (Arista Records and LaFace Records) accused Belgian radio aggregator Radionomy (owned by Universal Music Group's parent Vivendi) of copyright infringement.\\n\\n\\n=== 2016 boycott ===\\nIn February 2016, 100,000 people signed an online petition in less than 24 hours, calling for a boycott of Sony Music and all other Sony-affiliated businesses after rape allegations against music producer Dr. Luke were made by musical artist Kesha. Kesha asked a New York City Supreme Court to free her from her contract with Sony Music but the court denied the request, prompting a widespread public and media response.\\n\\n\\n== List of Sony Music Entertainment labels ==\\nFor a complete list of SME record labels, see List of Sony Music Entertainment labels.\\n\\n\\n=== Pre-eminent labels ===\\nColumbia Records\\nRCA Records\\nEpic Records\\nArista Records\\n\\n\\n=== Limited Liability companies ===\\nRoc Nation (distributed by Universal Music Group)\\n\\n\\n=== Genre-limited labels ===\\n\\n\\n=== Previously affiliated labels ===\\n19 Recordings (2001-2010) (previously through BMG and RCA Music Group, now part of Universal Music Group through Interscope Geffen A&M)\\nDef Jam Recordings (1985-1994) (previously through Columbia Records, now part of Universal Music Group)\\nLoud Records (1992-2002) (previously through Zoo Entertainment, then RCA Records, and later Columbia Records, now a new company called SRC Records through Universal Music Group)\\nChaos Recordings (1993-1995) (previously part of Columbia Records, now dissolved)\\nThe Work Group (1993-2000) (previously through Epic Records, now dissolved)\\nDate Records (1958-1970) (previously through Columbia Records, now dissolved)\\nAware Records (1997-2010) (now part of Universal Music Group through Republic Records)\\nPiperWorld Entertainment (2008-2013) (previously through Columbia Records)\\nThe Echo Label (2013-2017) (owned by BMG Chrysalis; now distributed by Warner Music Group)\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\n\\nList of Sony Music artists\\nSony/ATV Music Publishing\\nSony BMG\\nSony BMG CD copy protection scandal\\nSony Music Entertainment Japan\\nSony Music Australia\\nSony Music UK\\nSony Music India\\nList of record labels\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nOfficial site\\nYahoo! - Sony Music Entertainment Company Profile\\nSony Music's channel on YouTube\\nSony Music on IMDbPro (subscription required)\\nSony Music TV\\nSony Music publishing catalog at MusicBrainz\", \"rev_id\": 857474343, \"accessed\": \"2018-09-03 00:23:59.864295\", \"links\": [\"Bertelsmann Music Group, Germany (BMG)\", \"New York City\", \"Sony Music Entertainment Japan\", \"Funk\", \"CBS Corporation\", \"Warner Music Group\", \"List of Sony Music Entertainment labels\", \"Bertelsmann\", \"Dr. Luke\", \"Sigala\", \"YouTube\", \"Terre Haute, Indiana\", \"Mark Ronson\", \"Aware Records\", \"Philippines\", \"New York (state)\", \"IODA\", \"Joan Jett\", \"Ozzy Osbourne\", \"Paloma Faith\", \"Sony Music uk\", \"PlayStation\", \"PlayStation VR\", \"Columbia Pictures\", \"CBS Records (2006)\", \"The Amp\", \"RCA Records\", \"Clive Davis\", \"DV\", \"IMDb\", \"PlayStation 2\", \"Billboard (magazine)\", \"Irv Gotti\", \"Bertelsmann Music Group\", \"Nippon Columbia\", \"MusicBrainz\", \"Uptown Funk\", \"Los Angeles, California\", \"Sony Records\", \"Sony Music Entertainment\", \"Oriole Records (UK)\", \"American Record Corporation\", \"Kesha\", \"EMI Music Publishing\", \"CD price fixing\", \"One Direction\", \"Sony\", \"The Orchard (company)\", \"Album\", \"Entertainment law\", \"The Echo Label\", \"Universal Music Group\", \"Loud Records\", \"CBS\", \"Radionomy\", \"Sony \\u03b1\", \"Sony BMG Music Entertainment\", \"Universal Music\", \"London Grammar\", \"Def Jam Recordings\", \"Foo Fighters\", \"Single (music)\", \"The X Factor\", \"Sony Music Australia\", \"United States\", \"Sony Corporation of America\", \"PlayStation (console)\", \"Pharrell Williams\", \"Electric Light Orchestra\", \"Doug Morris\", \"Supreme Court of British Columbia\", \"Columbia Phonograph Company\", \"PlayStation 4\", \"Michael Jackson\", \"Sony BMG\", \"NBC\", \"LP record\", \"EMI\", \"Invincible (Michael Jackson album)\", \"Robbie Williams\", \"Columbia Records\", \"Red Essential\", \"Entertainment\", \"DJ Fresh\", \"List of record labels\", \"Okeh Records\", \"Bridgeport, Connecticut\", \"Interscope Geffen A&M\", \"Republic Records\", \"Pitman, New Jersey\", \"Craig David\", \"Best Buy\", \"Arista Records\", \"List of Sony Music artists\", \"BBC\", \"PlayStation 3\", \"Sony BMG CD copy protection scandal\", \"Sony Music\", \"Roc Nation\", \"BMG Rights Management\", \"Rob Stringer\", \"Sony Entertainment\", \"MinX\", \"Sony Music India\", \"Sony Music Entertainment Japan (Japanese music business)\", \"Syco\", \"Date Records\", \"Vivendi\", \"Epic Records\", \"LaFace Records\", \"Jason Iley\", \"IsoHunt\", \"Nintendo Switch\", \"Henry Lee Summer\", \"Got Talent\", \"Ministry of Sound\", \"Sony/ATV Music Publishing\", \"SRC Records\", \"Tommy Mottola\", \"William S.

Since at least the 19th century, \\\"London\\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, a region governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly.London is one of the leading global cities in the arts, commerce, education, entertainment, fashion, finance, healthcare, media, professional services, research and development, tourism and transportation. It is the world's largest financial centre and has the fifth or sixth largest metropolitan area GDP in the world. London is often regarded as a world cultural capital. It is the world's most-visited city as measured by international arrivals and has the world's largest city airport system measured by passenger traffic. It is the world's leading investment destination, hosting more international retailers and ultra high-net-worth individuals than any other city. London's universities form the largest concentration of higher education institutes in Europe. In 2012, London became the first city to have hosted the modern Summer Olympic Games three times.London has a diverse range of people and cultures, and more than 300 languages are spoken in the region. Its estimated mid-2016 municipal population (corresponding to Greater London) was 8,787,892, the largest of any city in the European Union and accounting for 13.4% of the UK population. London's urban area is the second most populous in the EU, after Paris, with 9,787,426 inhabitants at the 2011 census. The city's metropolitan area is the most populous in the EU with 14,040,163 inhabitants in 2016, while the Greater London Authority states the population of the city-region (covering a large part of the south east) as 22.7 million. London was the world's most populous city from around 1831 to 1925.\\nLondon contains four World Heritage Sites: the Tower of London; Kew Gardens; the site comprising the Palace of Westminster, Westminster Abbey, and St Margaret's Church; and the historic settlement of Greenwich (in which the Royal Observatory, Greenwich defines the Prime Meridian, 0deg longitude, and GMT). Other landmarks include Buckingham Palace, the London Eye, Piccadilly Circus, St Paul's Cathedral, Tower Bridge, Trafalgar Square and The Shard. London is home to numerous museums, galleries, libraries, sporting events and other cultural institutions, including the British Museum, National Gallery, Natural History Museum, Tate Modern, British Library and West End theatres. The London Underground is the oldest underground railway network in the world.\\n\\n\\n== Etymology ==\\n\\nThe etymology of London is uncertain. It is an ancient name, attested already in the first century AD, usually in the Latinised form Londinium; for example, handwritten Roman tablets recovered in the city originating from AD 65/70-80 include the word Londinio (\\\"in London\\\").Over the years, the name has attracted many mythicising explanations. The earliest attested appears in Geoffrey of Monmouth's Historia Regum Britanniae, written around 1136. This had it that the name originated from a supposed King Lud, who had allegedly taken over the city and named it Kaerlud.Modern scientific analyses of the name must account for the origins of the different forms found in early sources Latin (usually Londinium), Old English (usually Lunden), and Welsh (usually Llundein), with reference to the known developments over time of sounds in those different languages. It is agreed that the name came into these languages from Common Brythonic; recent work tends to reconstruct the lost Celtic form of the name as *[Londonjon] or something similar. This was adapted into Latin as Londinium and borrowed into West Germanic, the ancestor-language of English, before English had become widely spoken in what later became England.The etymology and original meaning of the Common Brythonic form is much debated. A prominent explanation was Richard Coates's 1998 argument that the name derived from pre-Celtic Old European *(p)lowonida, meaning \\\"river too wide to ford\\\". Coates suggested that this was a name given to the part of the River Thames which flows through London; from this, the settlement gained the Celtic form of its name, *Lowonidonjon. However, most work has accepted a Celtic origin for the name, and recent studies have favoured an explanation along the lines of a Celtic derivative of an proto-Indo-European root *lendh- ('sink, cause to sink'), combined with the Celtic suffix *-injo- or *-onjo- (used to form place-names). Peter Schrijver has specifically suggested, on these grounds, that the name originally meant 'place that floods (periodically, tidally)'.Until 1889, the name \\\"London\\\" officially applied only to the City of London, but since then it has also referred to the County of London and now to Greater London.\\\"London\\\" is sometimes abbreviated as \\\"L'don\\\" or \\\"LDN\\\".\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\n\\n=== Prehistory ===\\nTwo recent discoveries indicate probable very early settlements near the Thames in the London area. In 1993, the remains of a Bronze Age bridge were found on the south foreshore, upstream of Vauxhall Bridge. This bridge either crossed the Thames or reached a now lost island in it. Two of those timbers were radiocarbon dated to between 1750 BC and 1285 BC. In 2010 the foundations of a large timber structure, dated to between 4800 BC and 4500 BC, were found on the Thames's south foreshore, downstream of Vauxhall Bridge. The function of the mesolithic structure is not known. Both structures are on the south bank, at a natural crossing point where the River Effra flows into the Thames.\\n\\n\\n=== Roman London ===\\n\\nAlthough there is evidence of scattered Brythonic settlements in the area, the first major settlement was founded by the Romans about four years after the invasion of AD 43. This lasted only until around AD 61, when the Iceni tribe led by Queen Boudica stormed it, burning it to the ground. The next, heavily planned, incarnation of Londinium prospered, and it superseded Colchester as the capital of the Roman province of Britannia in 100. At its height in the 2nd century, Roman London had a population of around 60,000.\\n\\n\\n=== Anglo-Saxon London (and Viking period) ===\\nWith the collapse of Roman rule in the early 5th century, London ceased to be a capital, and the walled city of Londinium was effectively abandoned, although Roman civilisation continued in the area of St Martin-in-the-Fields until around 450. From around 500, an Anglo-Saxon settlement known as Lundenwic developed slightly west of the old Roman city. By about 680, the city had regrown into a major port, although there is little evidence of large-scale production. From the 820s repeated Viking assaults brought decline. Three are recorded; those in 851 and 886 succeeded, while the last, in 994, was rebuffed.\\n\\nThe Vikings established Danelaw over much of eastern and northern England; its boundary stretched roughly from London to Chester. It was an area of political and geographical control imposed by the Viking incursions which was formally agreed by the Danish warlord, Guthrum and the West Saxon king Alfred the Great in 886. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle recorded that Alfred \\\"refounded\\\" London in 886. Archaeological research shows that this involved abandonment of Lundenwic and a revival of life and trade within the old Roman walls. London then grew slowly until about 950, after which activity increased dramatically.By the 11th century, London was beyond all comparison the largest town in England. Westminster Abbey, rebuilt in the Romanesque style by King Edward the Confessor, was one of the grandest churches in Europe. Winchester had previously been the capital of Anglo-Saxon England, but from this time on, London became the main forum for foreign traders and the base for defence in time of war. In the view of Frank Stenton: \\\"It had the resources, and it was rapidly developing the dignity and the political self-consciousness appropriate to a national capital.\\\"\\n\\n\\n=== Middle Ages ===\\n\\nAfter winning the Battle of Hastings, William, Duke of Normandy was crowned King of England in the newly completed Westminster Abbey on Christmas Day 1066. William constructed the Tower of London, the first of the many Norman castles in England to be rebuilt in stone, in the southeastern corner of the city, to intimidate the native inhabitants. In 1097, William II began the building of Westminster Hall, close by the abbey of the same name. The hall became the basis of a new Palace of Westminster.In the 12th century, the institutions of central government, which had hitherto accompanied the royal English court as it moved around the country, grew in size and sophistication and became increasingly fixed in one place. For most purposes this was Westminster, although the royal treasury, having been moved from Winchester, came to rest in the Tower. While the City of Westminster developed into a true capital in governmental terms, its distinct neighbour, the City of London, remained England's largest city and principal commercial centre, and it flourished under its own unique administration, the Corporation of London. In 1100, its population was around 18,000; by 1300 it had grown to nearly 100,000. Disaster struck in the form of the Black Death in the mid-14th century, when London lost nearly a third of its population. London was the focus of the Peasants' Revolt in 1381.London was also a centre of England's Jewish population before their expulsion by Edward I in 1290. Violence against Jews took place in 1190, after it was rumoured that the new King had ordered their massacre after they had presented themselves at his coronation. In 1264 during the Second Barons' War, Simon de Montfort's rebels killed 500 Jews while attempting to seize records of debts.\\n\\n\\n=== Early modern ===\\n\\nDuring the Tudor period the Reformation produced a gradual shift to Protestantism, and much of London property passed from church to private ownership, which accelerated trade and business in the city. In 1475, the Hanseatic League set up its main trading base (kontor) of England in London, called the Stalhof or Steelyard. It existed until 1853, when the Hanseatic cities of Lubeck, Bremen and Hamburg sold the property to South Eastern Railway. Woollen cloth was shipped undyed and undressed from 14th/15th century London to the nearby shores of the Low Countries, where it was considered indispensable.But the reach of English maritime enterprise hardly extended beyond the seas of north-west Europe. The commercial route to Italy and the Mediterranean Sea normally lay through Antwerp and over the Alps; any ships passing through the Strait of Gibraltar to or from England were likely to be Italian or Ragusan. Upon the re-opening of the Netherlands to English shipping in January 1565, there ensued a strong outburst of commercial activity. The Royal Exchange was founded. Mercantilism grew, and monopoly trading companies such as the East India Company were established, with trade expanding to the New World. London became the principal North Sea port, with migrants arriving from England and abroad. The population rose from an estimated 50,000 in 1530 to about 225,000 in 1605.In the 16th century William Shakespeare and his contemporaries lived in London at a time of hostility to the development of the theatre. By the end of the Tudor period in 1603, London was still very compact. There was an assassination attempt on James I in Westminster, in the Gunpowder Plot on 5 November 1605.\\n\\nIn the English Civil War the majority of Londoners supported the Parliamentary cause. After an initial advance by the Royalists in 1642, culminating in the battles of Brentford and Turnham Green, London was surrounded by a defensive perimeter wall known as the Lines of Communication. The lines were built by up to 20,000 people, and were completed in under two months.\\nThe fortifications failed their only test when the New Model Army entered London in 1647, and they were levelled by Parliament the same year.London was plagued by disease in the early 17th century, culminating in the Great Plague of 1665-1666, which killed up to 100,000 people, or a fifth of the population.\\n\\nThe Great Fire of London broke out in 1666 in Pudding Lane in the city and quickly swept through the wooden buildings. Rebuilding took over ten years and was supervised by Robert Hooke as Surveyor of London. In 1708 Christopher Wren's masterpiece, St Paul's Cathedral was completed. During the Georgian era, new districts such as Mayfair were formed in the west; new bridges over the Thames encouraged development in South London. In the east, the Port of London expanded downstream. London's development as an international financial centre matured for much of the 1700s.\\nIn 1762, George III acquired Buckingham House and it was enlarged over the next 75 years. During the 18th century, London was dogged by crime, and the Bow Street Runners were established in 1750 as a professional police force. In total, more than 200 offences were punishable by death, including petty theft. Most children born in the city died before reaching their third birthday.\\n\\nThe coffeehouse became a popular place to debate ideas, with growing literacy and the development of the printing press making news widely available; and Fleet Street became the centre of the British press. Following the invasion of Amsterdam by Napoleonic armies, many financiers relocated to London, especially a large Jewish community, and the first London international issue was arranged in 1817. Around the same time, the Royal Navy became the world leading war fleet, acting as a serious deterrent to potential economic adversaries of the United Kingdom. The repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846 was specifically aimed at weakening Dutch economic power. London then overtook Amsterdam as the leading international financial centre. In 1888, London became home to a series of murders by a man known only as Jack the Ripper and It has since become one of the world's most famous unsolved mysteries.\\nAccording to Samuel Johnson:\\n\\nYou find no man, at all intellectual, who is willing to leave London. No, Sir, when a man is tired of London, he is tired of life; for there is in London all that life can afford.\\n\\n\\n=== Late modern and contemporary ===\\n\\nLondon was the world's largest city from about 1831 to 1925. London's overcrowded conditions led to cholera epidemics, claiming 14,000 lives in 1848, and 6,000 in 1866. Rising traffic congestion led to the creation of the world's first local urban rail network. The Metropolitan Board of Works oversaw infrastructure expansion in the capital and some of the surrounding counties; it was abolished in 1889 when the London County Council was created out of those areas of the counties surrounding the capital. London was bombed by the Germans during the First World War, and during the Second World War, the Blitz and other bombings by the German Luftwaffe killed over 30,000 Londoners, destroying large tracts of housing and other buildings across the city. Immediately after the war, the 1948 Summer Olympics were held at the original Wembley Stadium, at a time when London was still recovering from the war.\\n\\nFrom the 1940s onwards, London became home to a large number of immigrants, primarily from Commonwealth countries such as Jamaica, India, Bangladesh and Pakistan, making London one of the most diverse cities worldwide. In 1951, the Festival of Britain was held on the South Bank. The Great Smog of 1952 led to the Clean Air Act 1956, which ended the \\\"pea soup fogs\\\" for which London had been notorious.Primarily starting in the mid-1960s, London became a centre for the worldwide youth culture, exemplified by the Swinging London subculture associated with the King's Road, Chelsea and Carnaby Street. The role of trendsetter was revived during the punk era. In 1965 London's political boundaries were expanded to take into account the growth of the urban area and a new Greater London Council was created. During The Troubles in Northern Ireland, London was subjected to bombing attacks by the Provisional IRA for two decades, starting with the Old Bailey bombing in 1973. Racial inequality was highlighted by the 1981 Brixton riot.Greater London's population declined steadily in the decades after the Second World War, from an estimated peak of 8.6 million in 1939 to around 6.8 million in the 1980s. The principal ports for London moved downstream to Felixstowe and Tilbury, with the London Docklands area becoming a focus for regeneration, including the Canary Wharf development. This was borne out of London's ever-increasing role as a major international financial centre during the 1980s. The Thames Barrier was completed in the 1980s to protect London against tidal surges from the North Sea.\\n\\nThe Greater London Council was abolished in 1986, which left London without a central administration until 2000 when London-wide government was restored, with the creation of the Greater London Authority. To celebrate the start of the 21st century, the Millennium Dome, London Eye and Millennium Bridge were constructed. On 6 July 2005 London was awarded the 2012 Summer Olympics, making London the first city to stage the Olympic Games three times. On 7 July 2005, three London Underground trains and a double-decker bus were bombed in a series of terrorist attacks.In 2008, London named alongside New York City and Hong Kong as Nylonkong, being hailed as the world's three most influential global cities. In January 2015, Greater London's population was estimated to be 8.63 million, the highest level since 1939. During the Brexit referendum in 2016, the UK as a whole decided to leave the European Union, but a majority of London constituencies voted to remain in the EU.\\n\\n\\n== Administration ==\\n\\n\\n=== Local government ===\\n\\nThe administration of London is formed of two tiers: a citywide, strategic tier and a local tier. Citywide administration is coordinated by the Greater London Authority (GLA), while local administration is carried out by 33 smaller authorities. The GLA consists of two elected components: the Mayor of London, who has executive powers, and the London Assembly, which scrutinises the mayor's decisions and can accept or reject the mayor's budget proposals each year.\\nThe headquarters of the GLA is City Hall, Southwark; the mayor is Sadiq Khan, the first Muslim mayor of a major Western capital. The mayor's statutory planning strategy is published as the London Plan, which was most recently revised in 2011. The local authorities are the councils of the 32 London boroughs and the City of London Corporation. They are responsible for most local services, such as local planning, schools, social services, local roads and refuse collection. Certain functions, such as waste management, are provided through joint arrangements. In 2009-2010 the combined revenue expenditure by London councils and the GLA amounted to just over PS22 billion (PS14.7 billion for the boroughs and PS7.4 billion for the GLA).The London Fire Brigade is the statutory fire and rescue service for Greater London. It is run by the London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority and is the third largest fire service in the world. National Health Service ambulance services are provided by the London Ambulance Service (LAS) NHS Trust, the largest free-at-the-point-of-use emergency ambulance service in the world. The London Air Ambulance charity operates in conjunction with the LAS where required. Her Majesty's Coastguard and the Royal National Lifeboat Institution operate on the River Thames, which is under the jurisdiction of the Port of London Authority from Teddington Lock to the sea.\\n\\n\\n=== National government ===\\n\\nLondon is the seat of the Government of the United Kingdom. Many government departments, as well as the Prime Minister's residence at 10 Downing Street, are based close to the Palace of Westminster, particularly along Whitehall. The British Parliament is often referred to as the \\\"Mother of Parliaments\\\" (although this sobriquet was first applied to England itself, and not to Westminster, by John Bright) because it has been a model for many other parliamentary systems. There are 73 Members of Parliament (MPs) from London, elected from local parliamentary constituencies in the national Parliament. As of May 2015, 49 are from the Labour Party, 21 are Conservatives, and three are Liberal Democrat.The UK government ministerial post of Minister for London was created in 1994 and currently occupied by Jo Johnson.\\n\\n\\n=== Policing and crime ===\\n\\nPolicing in Greater London, with the exception of the City of London, is provided by the Metropolitan Police Service, overseen by the Mayor through the Mayor's Office for Policing and Crime (MOPAC). The City of London has its own police force - the City of London Police. The British Transport Police are responsible for police services on National Rail, London Underground, Docklands Light Railway and Tramlink services.\\nA fourth police force in London, the Ministry of Defence Police, do not generally become involved with policing the general public.\\nCrime rates vary widely by area, ranging from parts with serious issues to parts considered very safe. Today crime figures are made available nationally at Local Authority and Ward level. In 2015 there were 118 homicides, a 25.5% increase over 2014. The Metropolitan Police have made detailed crime figures, broken down by category at borough and ward level, available on their website since 2000.Recorded crime has been rising in London, notably violent crime and murder by stabbing and other means have risen.  There have been 50 murders from the start of 2018 to mid April 2018.  Funding cuts to police in London are likely to have contributed to this, though other factors are also involved.\\n\\n\\n== Geography ==\\n\\n\\n=== Scope ===\\n\\nLondon, also referred to as Greater London, is one of nine regions of England and the top-level subdivision covering most of the city's metropolis. The small ancient City of London at its core once comprised the whole settlement, but as its urban area grew, the Corporation of London resisted attempts to amalgamate the city with its suburbs, causing \\\"London\\\" to be defined in a number of ways for different purposes.Forty per cent of Greater London is covered by the London post town, within which 'LONDON' forms part of postal addresses. The London telephone area code (020) covers a larger area, similar in size to Greater London, although some outer districts are excluded and some places just outside are included. The Greater London boundary has been aligned to the M25 motorway in places.Outward urban expansion is now prevented by the Metropolitan Green Belt, although the built-up area extends beyond the boundary in places, resulting in a separately defined Greater London Urban Area. Beyond this is the vast London commuter belt. Greater London is split for some purposes into Inner London and Outer London. The city is split by the River Thames into North and South, with an informal central London area in its interior. The coordinates of the nominal centre of London, traditionally considered to be the original Eleanor Cross at Charing Cross near the junction of Trafalgar Square and Whitehall, are about 51deg30'26''N 00deg07'39''W. However the geographical centre of London, on one definition, is in the London Borough of Lambeth, just 0.1 miles to the northeast of Lambeth North tube station.\\n\\n\\n=== Status ===\\nWithin London, both the City of London and the City of Westminster have city status and both the City of London and the remainder of Greater London are counties for the purposes of lieutenancies. The area of Greater London has incorporated areas that are part of the historic counties of Middlesex, Kent, Surrey, Essex and Hertfordshire. London's status as the capital of England, and later the United Kingdom, has never been granted or confirmed officially--by statute or in written form.Its position was formed through constitutional convention, making its status as de facto capital a part of the UK's uncodified constitution. The capital of England was moved to London from Winchester as the Palace of Westminster developed in the 12th and 13th centuries to become the permanent location of the royal court, and thus the political capital of the nation. More recently, Greater London has been defined as a region of England and in this context is known as London.\\n\\n\\n=== Topography ===\\n\\nGreater London encompasses a total area of 1,583 square kilometres (611 sq mi), an area which had a population of 7,172,036 in 2001 and a population density of 4,542 inhabitants per square kilometre (11,760/sq mi). The extended area known as the London Metropolitan Region or the London Metropolitan Agglomeration, comprises a total area of 8,382 square kilometres (3,236 sq mi) has a population of 13,709,000 and a population density of 1,510 inhabitants per square kilometre (3,900/sq mi). Modern London stands on the Thames, its primary geographical feature, a navigable river which crosses the city from the south-west to the east. The Thames Valley is a floodplain surrounded by gently rolling hills including Parliament Hill, Addington Hills, and Primrose Hill. Historically London grew up at the lowest bridging point on the Thames. The Thames was once a much broader, shallower river with extensive marshlands; at high tide, its shores reached five times their present width.Since the Victorian era the Thames has been extensively embanked, and many of its London tributaries now flow underground. The Thames is a tidal river, and London is vulnerable to flooding. The threat has increased over time because of a slow but continuous rise in high water level by the slow 'tilting' of the British Isles (up in Scotland and Northern Ireland and down in southern parts of England, Wales and Ireland) caused by post-glacial rebound.In 1974, a decade of work began on the construction of the Thames Barrier across the Thames at Woolwich to deal with this threat. While the barrier is expected to function as designed until roughly 2070, concepts for its future enlargement or redesign are already being discussed.\\n\\n\\n=== Climate ===\\n\\nLondon has a temperate oceanic climate (Koppen: Cfb ), similar to all of southern England. Despite its reputation as being a rainy city, London receives less precipitation in a year than Rome, Bordeaux, Lisbon, Naples, Sydney and New York City. Temperature extremes for all sites in the London area range from 38.1 degC (100.6 degF) at Kew during August 2003 down to -16.1 degC (3.0 degF) at Northolt during January 1962.Summers are generally warm. London's average July high is 24 degC (74 degF). On average London will see 31 days above 25 degC (77.0 degF) each year, and 4.2 days above 30.0 degC (86.0 degF) every year. During the 2003 European heat wave there were 14 consecutive days above 30 degC (86.0 degF) and 2 consecutive days where temperatures reached 38 degC (100 degF), leading to hundreds of heat related deaths.Winters are generally cool, cloudy and damp with little temperature variation. Snowfall occurs occasionally and can cause travel disruption when this happens. Snowfall is more common in outer London. Spring and autumn are mixed seasons and can be pleasant. As a large city, London has a considerable urban heat island effect, making the centre of London at times 5 degC (9 degF) warmer than the suburbs and outskirts. The effect of this can be seen below when comparing London Heathrow, 15 miles (24 km) west of London, with the London Weather Centre, in the city centre.\\n\\n\\n=== Districts ===\\n\\nLondon's vast urban area is often described using a set of district names, such as Bloomsbury, Mayfair, Wembley and Whitechapel. These are either informal designations, reflect the names of villages that have been absorbed by sprawl, or are superseded administrative units such as parishes or former boroughs.\\nSuch names have remained in use through tradition, each referring to a local area with its own distinctive character, but without official boundaries. Since 1965 Greater London has been divided into 32 London boroughs in addition to the ancient City of London. The City of London is the main financial district, and Canary Wharf has recently developed into a new financial and commercial hub in the Docklands to the east.\\nThe West End is London's main entertainment and shopping district, attracting tourists. West London includes expensive residential areas where properties can sell for tens of millions of pounds. The average price for properties in Kensington and Chelsea is over PS2 million with a similarly high outlay in most of central London.The East End is the area closest to the original Port of London, known for its high immigrant population, as well as for being one of the poorest areas in London. The surrounding East London area saw much of London's early industrial development; now, brownfield sites throughout the area are being redeveloped as part of the Thames Gateway including the London Riverside and Lower Lea Valley, which was developed into the Olympic Park for the 2012 Olympics and Paralympics.\\n\\n\\n=== Architecture ===\\n\\nLondon's buildings are too diverse to be characterised by any particular architectural style, partly because of their varying ages. Many grand houses and public buildings, such as the National Gallery, are constructed from Portland stone. Some areas of the city, particularly those just west of the centre, are characterised by white stucco or whitewashed buildings. Few structures in central London pre-date the Great Fire of 1666, these being a few trace Roman remains, the Tower of London and a few scattered Tudor survivors in the City. Further out is, for example, the Tudor-period Hampton Court Palace, England's oldest surviving Tudor palace, built by Cardinal Thomas Wolsey c.1515.17th-century churches by Wren, neoclassical financial institutions such as the Royal Exchange and the Bank of England, to the early 20th century Old Bailey and the 1960s Barbican Estate form part of the varied architectural heritage.\\n\\nThe disused - but soon to be rejuvenated - 1939 Battersea Power Station by the river in the south-west is a local landmark, while some railway termini are excellent examples of Victorian architecture, most notably St. Pancras and Paddington. The density of London varies, with high employment density in the central area, high residential densities in inner London, and lower densities in Outer London.\\nThe Monument in the City of London provides views of the surrounding area while commemorating the Great Fire of London, which originated nearby. Marble Arch and Wellington Arch, at the north and south ends of Park Lane, respectively, have royal connections, as do the Albert Memorial and Royal Albert Hall in Kensington. Nelson's Column is a nationally recognised monument in Trafalgar Square, one of the focal points of central London. Older buildings are mainly brick built, most commonly the yellow London stock brick or a warm orange-red variety, often decorated with carvings and white plaster mouldings.In the dense areas, most of the concentration is via medium- and high-rise buildings. London's skyscrapers, such as 30 St Mary Axe, Tower 42, the Broadgate Tower and One Canada Square, are mostly in the two financial districts, the City of London and Canary Wharf. High-rise development is restricted at certain sites if it would obstruct protected views of St Paul's Cathedral and other historic buildings. Nevertheless, there are a number of very tall skyscrapers in central London (see Tall buildings in London), including the 95-storey Shard London Bridge, the tallest building in the European Union.\\nOther notable modern buildings include City Hall in Southwark with its distinctive oval shape and the British Library in Somers Town/Kings Cross. What was formerly the Millennium Dome, by the Thames to the east of Canary Wharf, is now an entertainment venue called the O2 Arena.\\n\\n\\n=== Cityscape ===\\n\\n\\n=== Natural history ===\\nThe London Natural History Society suggest that London is \\\"one of the World's Greenest Cities\\\" with more than 40 percent green space or open water. They indicate that 2000 species of flowering plant have been found growing there and that the tidal Thames supports 120 species of fish. They also state that over 60 species of bird nest in central London and that their members have recorded 47 species of butterfly, 1173 moths and more than 270 kinds of spider around London. London's wetland areas support nationally important populations of many water birds. London has 38 Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs), two National Nature Reserves and 76 Local Nature Reserves.Amphibians are common in the capital, including smooth newts living by the Tate Modern, and common frogs, common toads, palmate newts and great crested newts. On the other hand, native reptiles such as slowworms, common lizards, grass snakes and adders, are mostly only seen in Outer London.\\n\\nAmong other inhabitants of London are 10,000 red foxes, so that there are now 16 foxes for every square mile (2.6 square kilometres) of London. These urban foxes are noticeably bolder than their country cousins, sharing the pavement with pedestrians and raising cubs in people's backyards. Foxes have even sneaked into the Houses of Parliament, where one was found asleep on a filing cabinet. Another broke into the grounds of Buckingham Palace, reportedly killing some of Queen Elizabeth II's prized pink flamingos. Generally, however, foxes and city folk appear to get along. A survey in 2001 by the London-based Mammal Society found that 80 percent of 3,779 respondents who volunteered to keep a diary of garden mammal visits liked having them around. This sample cannot be taken to represent Londoners as a whole.Other mammals found in Greater London are hedgehogs, rats, mice, rabbit, shrew, vole, and squirrels, In wilder areas of Outer London, such as Epping Forest, a wide variety of mammals are found including hare, badger, field, bank and water vole, wood mouse, yellow-necked mouse, mole, shrew, and weasel, in addition to fox, squirrel and hedgehog. A dead otter was found at The Highway, in Wapping, about a mile from the Tower Bridge, which would suggest that they have begun to move back after being absent a hundred years from the city. Ten of England's eighteen species of bats have been recorded in Epping Forest: soprano, nathusius and common pipistrelles, noctule, serotine, barbastelle, daubenton's, brown Long-eared, natterer's and leisler's.Among the strange sights seen in London have been a whale in the Thames, while the BBC Two programme \\\"Natural World: Unnatural History of London\\\" shows pigeons using the London Underground to get around the city, a seal that takes fish from fishmongers outside Billingsgate Fish Market, and foxes that will \\\"sit\\\" if given sausages.Herds of red and fallow deer also roam freely within much of Richmond and Bushy Park. A cull takes place each November and February to ensure numbers can be sustained. Epping Forest is also known for its fallow deer, which can frequently be seen in herds to the north of the Forest. A rare population of melanistic, black fallow deer is also maintained at the Deer Sanctuary near Theydon Bois. Muntjac deer, which escaped from deer parks at the turn of the twentieth century, are also found in the forest. While Londoners are accustomed to wildlife such as birds and foxes sharing the city, more recently urban deer have started becoming a regular feature, and whole herds of fallow deer come into residential areas at night to take advantage of London's green spaces.\\n\\n\\n== Demography ==\\n\\nThe 2011 census recorded that 2,998,264 people or 36.7% of London's population are foreign-born making London the city with the second largest immigrant population, behind New York City, in terms of absolute numbers. About 69% of children born in London in 2015 had at least one parent who was born abroad. The table to the right shows the most common countries of birth of London residents. Note that some of the German-born population, in 18th position, are British citizens from birth born to parents serving in the British Armed Forces in Germany.With increasing industrialisation, London's population grew rapidly throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, and it was for some time in the late 19th and early 20th centuries the most populous city in the world. Its population peaked at 8,615,245 in 1939 immediately before the outbreak of the Second World War, but had declined to 7,192,091 at the 2001 Census. However, the population then grew by just over a million between the 2001 and 2011 Censuses, to reach 8,173,941 in the latter enumeration.However, London's continuous urban area extends beyond the borders of Greater London and was home to 9,787,426 people in 2011, while its wider metropolitan area has a population of between 12 and 14 million depending on the definition used. According to Eurostat, London is the most populous city and metropolitan area of the European Union and the second most populous in Europe. During the period 1991-2001 a net 726,000 immigrants arrived in London.The region covers an area of 1,579 square kilometres (610 sq mi). The population density is 5,177 inhabitants per square kilometre (13,410/sq mi), more than ten times that of any other British region. In terms of population, London is the 19th largest city and the 18th largest metropolitan region in the world. As of  2014, London has the largest number of billionaires (British Pound Sterling) in the world, with 72 residing in the city. London ranks as one of the most expensive cities in the world, alongside Tokyo and Moscow.\\n\\n\\n=== Ethnic groups ===\\n\\nAccording to the Office for National Statistics, based on the 2011 Census estimates, 59.8 per cent of the 8,173,941 inhabitants of London were White, with 44.9 per cent White British, 2.2 per cent White Irish, 0.1 per cent gypsy/Irish traveller and 12.1 per cent classified as Other White.\\n20.9 per cent of Londoners are of Asian and mixed-Asian descent. 19.7 per cent are of full Asian descent, with those of mixed-Asian heritage comprising 1.2 of the population. Indians account for 6.6 per cent of the population, followed by Pakistanis and Bangladeshis at 2.7 per cent each. Chinese peoples account for 1.5 per cent of the population, with Arabs comprising 1.3 per cent. A further 4.9 per cent are classified as \\\"Other Asian\\\".\\n15.6 per cent of London's population are of Black and mixed-Black descent. 13.3 per cent are of full Black descent, with those of mixed-Black heritage comprising 2.3 per cent. Black Africans account for 7.0 per cent of London's population, with 4.2 per cent as Black Caribbean and 2.1 per cent as \\\"Other Black\\\". 5.0 per cent are of mixed race.\\nAcross London, Black and Asian children outnumber White British children by about six to four in state schools. Altogether at the 2011 census, of London's 1,624,768 population aged 0 to 15, 46.4 per cent were White, 19.8 per cent were Asian, 19 per cent were Black, 10.8 per cent were Mixed and 4 per cent represented another ethnic group. In January 2005, a survey of London's ethnic and religious diversity claimed that there were more than 300 languages spoken in London and more than 50 non-indigenous communities with a population of more than 10,000. Figures from the Office for National Statistics show that, in 2010, London's foreign-born population was 2,650,000 (33 per cent), up from 1,630,000 in 1997.\\nThe 2011 census showed that 36.7 per cent of Greater London's population were born outside the UK. A portion of the German-born population are likely to be British nationals born to parents serving in the British Armed Forces in Germany. Estimates produced by the Office for National Statistics indicate that the five largest foreign-born groups living in London in the period July 2009 to June 2010 were those born in India, Poland, the Republic of Ireland, Bangladesh and Nigeria.\\n\\n\\n=== Religion ===\\n\\nAccording to the 2011 Census, the largest religious groupings are Christians (48.4 per cent), followed by those of no religion (20.7 per cent), Muslims (12.4 per cent), no response (8.5 per cent), Hindus (5.0 per cent), Jews (1.8 per cent), Sikhs (1.5 per cent), Buddhists (1.0 per cent) and other (0.6 per cent).\\nLondon has traditionally been Christian, and has a large number of churches, particularly in the City of London. The well-known St Paul's Cathedral in the City and Southwark Cathedral south of the river are Anglican administrative centres, while the Archbishop of Canterbury, principal bishop of the Church of England and worldwide Anglican Communion, has his main residence at Lambeth Palace in the London Borough of Lambeth.\\n\\nImportant national and royal ceremonies are shared between St Paul's and Westminster Abbey. The Abbey is not to be confused with nearby Westminster Cathedral, which is the largest Roman Catholic cathedral in England and Wales. Despite the prevalence of Anglican churches, observance is very low within the Anglican denomination. Church attendance continues on a long, slow, steady decline, according to Church of England statistics.London is also home to sizeable Muslim, Hindu, Sikh, and Jewish communities. \\nNotable mosques include the East London Mosque in Tower Hamlets, which is allowed to give the Islamic call to prayer through loudspeakers, the London Central Mosque on the edge of Regent's Park and the Baitul Futuh of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community. Following the oil boom, increasing numbers of wealthy Middle-Eastern Arab Muslims have based themselves around Mayfair, Kensington, and Knightsbridge in West London. There are large Muslim communities in the eastern boroughs of Tower Hamlets and Newham.Large Hindu communities are in the north-western boroughs of Harrow and Brent, the latter of which hosts what was, until 2006, Europe's largest Hindu temple, Neasden Temple. London is also home to 44 Hindu temples, including the BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir London. There are Sikh communities in East and West London, particularly in Southall, home to one of the largest Sikh populations and the largest Sikh temple outside India.The majority of British Jews live in London, with significant Jewish communities in Stamford Hill, Stanmore, Golders Green, Finchley, Hampstead, Hendon and Edgware in North London. Bevis Marks Synagogue in the City of London is affiliated to London's historic Sephardic Jewish community. It is the only synagogue in Europe which has held regular services continuously for over 300 years. Stanmore and Canons Park Synagogue has the largest membership of any single Orthodox synagogue in the whole of Europe, overtaking Ilford synagogue (also in London) in 1998. The community set up the London Jewish Forum in 2006 in response to the growing significance of devolved London Government.\\n\\n\\n=== Accent ===\\nThere are many accents traditionally associated with London. The most well known of the London accents long ago acquired the Cockney label from London's East End, which is heard both in London itself, and across the wider South East England region more generally. The accent of a 21st-century Londoner varies widely; what is becoming more and more common amongst the under-30s however is some fusion of Cockney with a whole array of ethnic accents, in particular Caribbean, which form an accent labelled Multicultural London English (MLE). The other widely heard and spoken accent is RP (Received Pronunciation) in various forms, which can often be heard in the media and many of other traditional professions and beyond, although this accent is not limited to London and South East England, and can also be heard selectively throughout the whole UK amongst certain social groupings. Since the turn of the century the Cockney dialect is less common in the East End and has 'migrated' east to Havering and the county of Essex.\\n\\n\\n== Economy ==\\n\\nLondon produced in 2015 about PS378 billion (EUR530 billion or $600 billion), over 22% of UK GDP, while the economy of the London metropolitan area--the largest in Europe--generates about 30 per cent of the UK's GDP (or an estimated $669 billion in 2005). London has five major business districts: the City, Westminster, Canary Wharf, Camden & Islington and Lambeth & Southwark. One way to get an idea of their relative importance is to look at relative amounts of office space: Greater London had 27 million m2 of office space in 2001, and the City contains the most space, with 8 million m2 of office space. London has some of the highest real estate prices in the world. London is the world's most expensive office market for the last three years according to world property journal (2015) report. As of  2015 the residential property in London is worth $2.2 trillion - same value as that of Brazil annual GDP. The city has the highest property prices of any European city according to the Office for National Statistics and the European Office of Statistics. On average the price per square metre in central London is EUR24,252 (April 2014). This is higher than the property prices in other G8 European capital cities; Berlin EUR3,306, Rome EUR6,188 and Paris EUR11,229.\\n\\n\\n=== The City of London ===\\n\\nLondon finance industry is based in the City of London and Canary Wharf, the two major Central Business Districts in London. London is one of the pre-eminent financial centres of the world as the most important location for international finance. London took over as a major financial centre shortly after 1795 when the Dutch Republic collapsed before the Napoleonic armies. For many bankers established in Amsterdam (e.g. Hope, Baring), this was only time to move to London. The London financial elite was strengthened by a strong Jewish community from all over Europe capable of mastering the most sophisticated financial tools of the time. This unique concentration of talents accelerated the transition from the Commercial Revolution to the Industrial Revolution. By the end of the 19th century, Britain was the wealthiest of all nations, and London a leading financial centre. Still, as of 2016 London tops the world rankings on the Global Financial Centres Index (GFCI), and it ranked second in A.T. Kearney's 2018 Global Cities Index.London's largest industry is finance, and its financial exports make it a large contributor to the UK's balance of payments. Around 325,000 people were employed in financial services in London until mid-2007. London has over 480 overseas banks, more than any other city in the world. It is also the world's biggest currency trading centre, accounting for some 37 percent of the $5.1 trillion average daily volume, according to the BIS. Over 85 percent (3.2 million) of the employed population of greater London works in the services industries. Because of its prominent global role, London's economy had been affected by the financial crisis of 2007-2008. However, by 2010 the City has recovered; put in place new regulatory powers, proceeded to regain lost ground and re-established London's economic dominance. Along with professional services headquarters, the City of London is home to the Bank of England, London Stock Exchange, and Lloyd's of London insurance market.\\nOver half of the UK's top 100 listed companies (the FTSE 100) and over 100 of Europe's 500 largest companies have their headquarters in central London. Over 70 per cent of the FTSE 100 are within London's metropolitan area, and 75 per cent of Fortune 500 companies have offices in London.\\n\\n\\n=== Media and technology ===\\nMedia companies are concentrated in London and the media distribution industry is London's second most competitive sector. The BBC is a significant employer, while other broadcasters also have headquarters around the City. Many national newspapers are edited in London. London is a major retail centre and in 2010 had the highest non-food retail sales of any city in the world, with a total spend of around PS64.2 billion. The Port of London is the second-largest in the United Kingdom, handling 45 million tonnes of cargo each year.A growing number of technology companies are based in London notably in East London Tech City, also known as Silicon Roundabout. In April 2014, the city was among the first to receive a geoTLD. In February 2014 London was ranked as the European City of the Future  in the 2014/15 list by FDi Magazine.The gas and electricity distribution networks that manage and operate the towers, cables and pressure systems that deliver energy to consumers across the city are managed by National Grid plc, SGN and UK Power Networks.\\n\\n\\n=== Tourism ===\\n\\nLondon is one of the leading tourist destinations in the world and in 2015 was ranked as the most visited city in the world with over 65 million visits. It is also the top city in the world by visitor cross-border spending, estimated at US$20.23 billion in 2015. Tourism is one of London's prime industries, employing the equivalent of 350,000 full-time workers in 2003, and the city accounts for 54% of all inbound visitor spending in the UK. As of  2016 London is the world top city destination as ranked by TripAdvisor users.In 2015 the top most-visited attractions in the UK were all in London. The top 10 most visited attractions were: (with visits per venue) \\n\\nThe British Museum: 6,820,686\\nThe National Gallery: 5,908,254\\nThe Natural History Museum (South Kensington): 5,284,023\\nThe Southbank Centre: 5,102,883\\nTate Modern: 4,712,581\\nThe Victoria and Albert Museum (South Kensington): 3,432,325\\nThe Science Museum: 3,356,212\\nSomerset House: 3,235,104\\nThe Tower of London: 2,785,249\\nThe National Portrait Gallery: 2,145,486The number of hotel rooms in London in 2015 stood at 138,769, and is expected to grow over the years.\\n\\n\\n== Transport ==\\n\\nTransport is one of the four main areas of policy administered by the Mayor of London, however the mayor's financial control does not extend to the longer distance rail network that enters London. In 2007 he assumed responsibility for some local lines, which now form the London Overground network, adding to the existing responsibility for the London Underground, trams and buses. The public transport network is administered by Transport for London (TFL).\\nThe lines that formed the London Underground, as well as trams and buses, became part of an integrated transport system in 1933 when the London Passenger Transport Board or London Transport was created. Transport for London is now the statutory corporation responsible for most aspects of the transport system in Greater London, and is run by a board and a commissioner appointed by the Mayor of London.\\n\\n\\n=== Aviation ===\\n\\nLondon is a major international air transport hub with the busiest city airspace in the world. Eight airports use the word London in their name, but most traffic passes through six of these. Additionally, various other airports also serve London, catering primarily to general aviation flights.\\n\\nLondon Heathrow Airport, in Hillingdon, West London, was for many years the busiest airport in the world for international traffic, and is the major hub of the nation's flag carrier, British Airways.  In March 2008 its fifth terminal was opened. In 2014, Dubai gained from Heathrow the leading position in terms of international passenger traffic.\\nLondon Gatwick Airport, south of London in West Sussex, handles flights to more destinations than any other UK airport and is the main base of easyJet, the UK's largest airline by number of passengers.\\nLondon Stansted Airport, north-east of London in Essex, has flights that serve the greatest number of European destinations of any UK airport and is the main base of Ryanair, the world's largest international airline by number of international passengers.\\nLondon Luton Airport, to the north of London in Bedfordshire, is used by several budget airlines for short-haul flights.\\nLondon City Airport, the most central airport and the one with the shortest runway, in Newham, East London, is focused on business travellers, with a mixture of full-service short-haul scheduled flights and considerable business jet traffic.\\nLondon Southend Airport, east of London in Essex, is a smaller, regional airport that caters for short-haul flights on a limited, though growing, number of airlines. In 2017, international passengers made up over 95% of the total at Southend, the highest proportion of any London airport.\\n\\n\\n=== Rail ===\\n\\n\\n==== Underground and DLR ====\\n\\nThe London Underground, commonly referred to as the Tube, is the oldest and third longest metro system in the world. The system serves 270 stations and was formed from several private companies, including the world's first underground electric line, the City and South London Railway. It dates from 1863.Over four million journeys are made every day on the Underground network, over 1 billion each year. An investment programme is attempting to reduce congestion and improve reliability, including PS6.5 billion (EUR7.7 billion) spent before the 2012 Summer Olympics. The Docklands Light Railway (DLR), which opened in 1987, is a second, more local metro system using smaller and lighter tram-type vehicles that serve the Docklands, Greenwich and Lewisham.\\n\\n\\n==== Suburban ====\\n\\nThere are more than 360 railway stations in the London Travelcard Zones on an extensive above-ground suburban railway network. South London, particularly, has a high concentration of railways as it has fewer Underground lines. Most rail lines terminate around the centre of London, running into eighteen terminal stations, with the exception of the Thameslink trains connecting Bedford in the north and Brighton in the south via Luton and Gatwick airports. London has Britain's busiest station by number of passengers - Waterloo, with over 184 million people using the interchange station complex (which includes Waterloo East station) each year. Clapham Junction is the busiest station in Europe by the number of trains passing.\\nWith the need for more rail capacity in London, Crossrail is due to open in 2018. It will be a new railway line running east to west through London and into the Home Counties with a branch to Heathrow Airport. It is Europe's biggest construction project, with a PS15 billion projected cost.\\n\\n\\n==== Inter-city and international ====\\n\\nLondon is the centre of the National Rail network, with 70 percent of rail journeys starting or ending in London. Like suburban rail services, regional and inter-city trains depart from several termini around the city centre, linking London with the rest of Britain including Birmingham, Brighton, Reading, Bristol, Cardiff, Derby, Exeter, Sheffield, Southampton, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, Cambridge, Newcastle upon Tyne, Edinburgh and Glasgow.\\nSome international railway services to Continental Europe were operated during the 20th century as boat trains, such as the Admiraal de Ruijter to Amsterdam and the Night Ferry to Paris and Brussels. The opening of the Channel Tunnel in 1994 connected London directly to the continental rail network, allowing Eurostar services to begin. Since 2007, high-speed trains link St. Pancras International with Lille, Paris, Brussels, Amsterdam and other European tourist destinations via the High Speed 1 rail link and the Channel Tunnel. The first high-speed domestic trains started in June 2009 linking Kent to London. There are plans for a second high speed line linking London to the Midlands, North West England, and Yorkshire.\\n\\n\\n==== Freight ====\\nAlthough rail freight levels are far down compared to their height, significant quantities of cargo are also carried into and out of London by rail; chiefly building materials and landfill waste. As a major hub of the British railway network, London's tracks also carry large amounts of freight for the other regions, such as container freight from the Channel Tunnel and English Channel ports, and nuclear waste for reprocessing at Sellafield.\\n\\n\\n=== Buses and trams ===\\n\\nLondon's bus network is one of the largest in the world, running 24 hours a day, with about 8,500 buses, more than 700 bus routes and around 19,500 bus stops. In 2013, the network had more than 2 billion commuter trips per annum, more than the Underground. Around PS850 million is taken in revenue each year. London has the largest wheelchair accessible network in the world and, from the 3rd quarter of 2007, became more accessible to hearing and visually impaired passengers as audio-visual announcements were introduced. The distinctive red double-decker buses are an internationally recognised trademark of London transport along with black cabs and the Tube.London has a modern tram network, known as Tramlink, centred on Croydon in South London. The network has 39 stops and four routes, and carried 28 million people in 2013. Since June 2008 Transport for London has completely owned Tramlink, and it plans to spend PS54m by 2015 on maintenance, renewals, upgrades and capacity enhancements.\\n\\n\\n=== Cable car ===\\nLondon's first and only cable car, known as the Emirates Air Line, opened in June 2012. Crossing the River Thames, linking Greenwich Peninsula and the Royal Docks in the east of the city, the cable car is integrated with London's Oyster Card ticketing system, although special fares are charged. Costing PS60 million to build, it carries over 3,500 passengers every day, although this is very much lower than its capacity. Similar to the Santander Cycles bike hire scheme, the cable car is sponsored in a 10-year deal by the airline Emirates.\\n\\n\\n=== Cycling ===\\n\\nIn the whole Greater London Area, around 650,000 people use a bike everyday. But out of a total population of\\naround 8.8 million, this means that just around 7% of Greater London's population use a bike on an average day. This is a small proportion, when compared to many other cities in the world  A reason may well be the poor investments for cycling in London of about PS110 million per year, equating to around PS12 per person, which can be compared to PS22 in the Netherlands.Cycling is nevertheless becoming increasingly popular way to get around London. The launch of a cycle hire scheme in July 2010 has been successful and generally well received. The London Cycling Campaign lobbies for better provision. There are many cycle routes in London, including several Cycle Superhighways.\\n\\n\\n=== Port and river boats ===\\nFrom being the largest port in the world, the Port of London is now only the second-largest in the United Kingdom, handling 45 million tonnes of cargo each year. Most of this actually passes through the Port of Tilbury, outside the boundary of Greater London.\\nLondon has frequent river boat services on the Thames known as Thames Clippers. These run up to every 20 minutes between Embankment Pier and North Greenwich Pier. The Woolwich Ferry, with 2.5 million passengers every year, is a frequent service linking the North and South Circular Roads. Other operators run both commuter and tourist boat services in London.\\n\\n\\n=== Roads ===\\n\\nAlthough the majority of journeys involving central London are made by public transport, car travel is common in the suburbs. The inner ring road (around the city centre), the North and South Circular roads (in the suburbs), and the outer orbital motorway (the M25, outside the built-up area) encircle the city and are intersected by a number of busy radial routes--but very few motorways penetrate into inner London. A plan for a comprehensive network of motorways throughout the city (the Ringways Plan) was prepared in the 1960s but was mostly cancelled in the early 1970s. The M25 is the second-longest ring-road motorway in Europe at 117 mi (188 km) long. The A1 and M1 connect London to Leeds, and Newcastle and Edinburgh.\\nLondon is notorious for its traffic congestion, with the average speed of a car in the rush hour being 10.6 mph (17.1 km/h).In 2003, a congestion charge was introduced to reduce traffic volumes in the city centre. With a few exceptions, motorists are required to pay PS10 per day to drive within a defined zone encompassing much of central London. Motorists who are residents of the defined zone can buy a greatly reduced season pass. London government initially expected the Congestion Charge Zone to increase daily peak period Underground and bus users by 20,000 people, reduce road traffic by 10 to 15 per cent, increase traffic speeds by 10 to 15 per cent, and reduce queues by 20 to 30 per cent. Over the course of several years, the average number of cars entering the centre of London on a weekday was reduced from 195,000 to 125,000 cars - a 35-per-cent reduction of vehicles driven per day.\\n\\n\\n== Education ==\\n\\n\\n=== Tertiary education ===\\n\\nLondon is a major global centre of higher education teaching and research and has the largest concentration of higher education institutes in Europe. According to the QS World University Rankings 2015/16, London has the greatest concentration of top class universities in the world and its international student population of around 110,000 is larger than any other city in the world. A 2014 PricewaterhouseCoopers report termed London as the global capital of higher education.A number of world-leading education institutions are based in London. In the 2014/15 QS World University Rankings, Imperial College London is ranked joint 2nd in the world, University College London (UCL) is ranked 5th, and King's College London (KCL) is ranked 16th. The London School of Economics has been described as the world's leading social science institution for both teaching and research. The London Business School is considered one of the world's leading business schools and in 2015 its MBA programme was ranked second best in the world by the Financial Times.With 120,000 students in London, the federal University of London is the largest contact teaching university in the UK. It includes five multi-faculty universities - City, King's College London, Queen Mary, Royal Holloway and UCL - and a number of smaller and more specialised institutions including Birkbeck, the Courtauld Institute of Art, Goldsmiths, Guildhall School of Music and Drama, the London Business School, the London School of Economics, the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, the Royal Academy of Music, the Central School of Speech and Drama, the Royal Veterinary College and the School of Oriental and African Studies. Members of the University of London have their own admissions procedures, and some award their own degrees.\\nA number of universities in London are outside the University of London system, including Brunel University, Imperial College London, Kingston University, London Metropolitan University, University of East London, University of West London, University of Westminster, London South Bank University, Middlesex University, and University of the Arts London (the largest university of art, design, fashion, communication and the performing arts in Europe). In addition there are three international universities in London - Regent's University London, Richmond, The American International University in London and Schiller International University.\\n\\nLondon is home to five major medical schools - Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry (part of Queen Mary), King's College London School of Medicine (the largest medical school in Europe), Imperial College School of Medicine, UCL Medical School and St George's, University of London - and has a large number of affiliated teaching hospitals. It is also a major centre for biomedical research, and three of the UK's eight academic health science centres are based in the city - Imperial College Healthcare, King's Health Partners and UCL Partners (the largest such centre in Europe).\\nThere are a number of business schools in London, including the London School of Business and Finance, Cass Business School (part of City University London), Hult International Business School, ESCP Europe, European Business School London, Imperial College Business School, the London Business School and the UCL School of Management. London is also home to many specialist arts education institutions, including the Academy of Live and Recorded Arts, Central School of Ballet, LAMDA, London College of Contemporary Arts (LCCA), London Contemporary Dance School, National Centre for Circus Arts, RADA, Rambert School of Ballet and Contemporary Dance, the Royal College of Art, the Royal College of Music and Trinity Laban.\\n\\n\\n=== Primary and secondary education ===\\nThe majority of primary and secondary schools and further-education colleges in London are controlled by the London boroughs or otherwise state-funded; leading examples include Ashbourne College, Bethnal Green Academy, Brampton Manor Academy, City and Islington College, City of Westminster College, David Game College, Ealing, Hammersmith and West London College, Leyton Sixth Form College, London Academy of Excellence, Tower Hamlets College, and Newham Collegiate Sixth Form Centre. There are also a number of private schools and colleges in London, some old and famous, such as City of London School, Harrow, St Paul's School, Haberdashers' Aske's Boys' School, University College School, The John Lyon School, Highgate School and Westminster School.\\n\\n\\n== Culture ==\\n\\n\\n=== Leisure and entertainment ===\\n\\nLeisure is a major part of the London economy, with a 2003 report attributing a quarter of the entire UK leisure economy to London at 25.6 events per 1000 people. Globally, the city is amongst the big four fashion capitals of the world, and according to official statistics, London is the world's third busiest film production centre, presents more live comedy than any other city, and has the biggest theatre audience of any city in the world.\\n\\nWithin the City of Westminster in London, the entertainment district of the West End has its focus around Leicester Square, where London and world film premieres are held, and Piccadilly Circus, with its giant electronic advertisements. London's theatre district is here, as are many cinemas, bars, clubs, and restaurants, including the city's Chinatown district (in Soho), and just to the east is Covent Garden, an area housing speciality shops. The city is the home of Andrew Lloyd Webber, whose musicals have dominated the West End theatre since the late 20th century. The United Kingdom's Royal Ballet, English National Ballet, Royal Opera, and English National Opera are based in London and perform at the Royal Opera House, the London Coliseum, Sadler's Wells Theatre, and the Royal Albert Hall, as well as touring the country.\\n\\nIslington's 1 mile (1.6 km) long Upper Street, extending northwards from Angel, has more bars and restaurants than any other street in the United Kingdom. Europe's busiest shopping area is Oxford Street, a shopping street nearly 1 mile (1.6 km) long, making it the longest shopping street in the UK. Oxford Street is home to vast numbers of retailers and department stores, including the world-famous Selfridges flagship store. Knightsbridge, home to the equally renowned Harrods department store, lies to the south-west.\\nLondon is home to designers Vivienne Westwood, Galliano, Stella McCartney, Manolo Blahnik, and Jimmy Choo, among others; its renowned art and fashion schools make it an international centre of fashion alongside Paris, Milan, and New York City. London offers a great variety of cuisine as a result of its ethnically diverse population. Gastronomic centres include the Bangladeshi restaurants of Brick Lane and the Chinese restaurants of Chinatown.\\n\\nThere is a variety of annual events, beginning with the relatively new New Year's Day Parade, a fireworks display at the London Eye; the world's second largest street party, the Notting Hill Carnival, is held on the late August Bank Holiday each year. Traditional parades include November's Lord Mayor's Show, a centuries-old event celebrating the annual appointment of a new Lord Mayor of the City of London with a procession along the streets of the City, and June's Trooping the Colour, a formal military pageant performed by regiments of the Commonwealth and British armies to celebrate the Queen's Official Birthday.\\n\\n\\n=== Literature, film and television ===\\n\\nLondon has been the setting for many works of literature. The pilgrims in Geoffrey Chaucer's late 14th-century Canterbury Tales set out for Canterbury from London - specifically, from the Tabard inn, Southwark. William Shakespeare spent a large part of his life living and working in London; his contemporary Ben Jonson was also based there, and some of his work, most notably his play The Alchemist, was set in the city. A Journal of the Plague Year (1722) by Daniel Defoe is a fictionalisation of the events of the 1665 Great Plague.The literary centres of London have traditionally been hilly Hampstead and (since the early 20th century) Bloomsbury. Writers closely associated with the city are the diarist Samuel Pepys, noted for his eyewitness account of the Great Fire, Charles Dickens, whose representation of a foggy, snowy, grimy London of street sweepers and pickpockets has been a major influence on people's vision of early Victorian London, and Virginia Woolf, regarded as one of the foremost modernist literary figures of the 20th century.\\nLater important depictions of London from the 19th and early 20th centuries are Dickens' novels, and Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories. Also of significance is Letitia Elizabeth Landon's Calendar of the London Seasons (1834). Modern writers pervasively influenced by the city include Peter Ackroyd, author of a \\\"biography\\\" of London, and Iain Sinclair, who writes in the genre of psychogeography.\\n\\nLondon has played a significant role in the film industry. Major studios within or bordering London include Twickenham, Ealing, Shepperton, Pinewood, Elstree and Borehamwood, and a special effects and post-production community centred in Soho. Working Title Films has its headquarters in London. London has been the setting for films including Oliver Twist (1948), Scrooge (1951), Peter Pan (1953), The 101 Dalmatians (1961), My Fair Lady (1964), Mary Poppins (1964), Blowup (1966), The Long Good Friday (1980), Notting Hill (1999), Love Actually (2003), V For Vendetta (2005), Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber Of Fleet Street (2008) and The King's Speech (2010). Notable actors and filmmakers from London include; Charlie Chaplin, Alfred Hitchcock, Michael Caine, Helen Mirren, Gary Oldman, Christopher Nolan, Jude Law, Benedict Cumberbatch, Tom Hardy, Keira Knightley and Daniel Day-Lewis. As of  2008, the British Academy Film Awards have taken place at the Royal Opera House. London is a major centre for television production, with studios including BBC Television Centre, The Fountain Studios and The London Studios. Many television programmes have been set in London, including the popular television soap opera EastEnders, broadcast by the BBC since 1985.\\n\\n\\n=== Museums and art galleries ===\\n\\nLondon is home to many museums, galleries, and other institutions, many of which are free of admission charges and are major tourist attractions as well as playing a research role. The first of these to be established was the British Museum in Bloomsbury, in 1753. Originally containing antiquities, natural history specimens, and the national library, the museum now has 7 million artefacts from around the globe. In 1824, the National Gallery was founded to house the British national collection of Western paintings; this now occupies a prominent position in Trafalgar Square.\\nIn the latter half of the 19th century the locale of South Kensington was developed as \\\"Albertopolis\\\", a cultural and scientific quarter. Three major national museums are there: the Victoria and Albert Museum (for the applied arts), the Natural History Museum, and the Science Museum. The National Portrait Gallery was founded in 1856 to house depictions of figures from British history; its holdings now comprise the world's most extensive collection of portraits. The national gallery of British art is at Tate Britain, originally established as an annexe of the National Gallery in 1897. The Tate Gallery, as it was formerly known, also became a major centre for modern art; in 2000, this collection moved to Tate Modern, a new gallery housed in the former Bankside Power Station.\\n\\n\\n=== Music ===\\n\\nLondon is one of the major classical and popular music capitals of the world and hosts major music corporations, such as Universal Music Group International and Warner Music Group, as well as countless bands, musicians and industry professionals. The city is also home to many orchestras and concert halls, such as the Barbican Arts Centre (principal base of the London Symphony Orchestra and the London Symphony Chorus), Cadogan Hall (Royal Philharmonic Orchestra) and the Royal Albert Hall (The Proms). London's two main opera houses are the Royal Opera House and the London Coliseum. The UK's largest pipe organ is at the Royal Albert Hall. Other significant instruments are at the cathedrals and major churches. Several conservatoires are within the city: Royal Academy of Music, Royal College of Music, Guildhall School of Music and Drama and Trinity Laban.\\n\\nLondon has numerous venues for rock and pop concerts, including the world's busiest arena the O2 arena and other large arenas such as Earls Court, Wembley Arena, as well as many mid-sized venues, such as Brixton Academy, the Hammersmith Apollo and the Shepherd's Bush Empire. Several music festivals, including the Wireless Festival, South West Four, Lovebox, and Hyde Park's British Summer Time are all held in London. The city is home to the original Hard Rock Cafe and the Abbey Road Studios, where The Beatles recorded many of their hits. In the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, musicians and groups like Elton John, Pink Floyd, Cliff Richard, David Bowie, Queen, The Kinks, The Rolling Stones, The Who, Eric Clapton, Led Zeppelin, The Small Faces, Iron Maiden, Fleetwood Mac, Elvis Costello, Cat Stevens, The Police, The Cure, Madness, The Jam, Ultravox, Spandau Ballet, Culture Club, Dusty Springfield, Phil Collins, Rod Stewart, Adam Ant, Status Quo and Sade, derived their sound from the streets and rhythms of London.London was instrumental in the development of punk music, with figures such as the Sex Pistols, The Clash, and Vivienne Westwood all based in the city. More recent artists to emerge from the London music scene include George Michael's Wham!, Kate Bush, Seal, the Pet Shop Boys, Bananarama, Siouxsie and the Banshees, Bush, the Spice Girls, Jamiroquai, Blur, McFly, The Prodigy, Gorillaz, Bloc Party, Mumford & Sons, Coldplay, Amy Winehouse, Adele, Sam Smith, Ed Sheeran, Paloma Faith, Ellie Goulding, One Direction and Florence and the Machine. London is also a centre for urban music. In particular the genres UK garage, drum and bass, dubstep and grime evolved in the city from the foreign genres of hip hop and reggae, alongside local drum and bass. Music station BBC Radio 1Xtra was set up to support the rise of local urban contemporary music both in London and in the rest of the United Kingdom.\\n\\n\\n== Notable people ==\\n\\n\\n== Recreation ==\\n\\n\\n=== Parks and open spaces ===\\n\\nA 2013 report by the City of London Corporation said that London is the \\\"greenest city\\\" in Europe with 35,000 acres of public parks, woodlands and gardens. The largest parks in the central area of London are three of the eight Royal Parks, namely Hyde Park and its neighbour Kensington Gardens in the west, and Regent's Park to the north. Hyde Park in particular is popular for sports and sometimes hosts open-air concerts. Regent's Park contains London Zoo, the world's oldest scientific zoo, and is near the tourist attraction of Madame Tussauds Wax Museum. Primrose Hill, immediately to the north of Regent's Park, at 256 feet (78 m) is a popular spot from which to view the city skyline.\\nClose to Hyde Park are smaller Royal Parks, Green Park and St. James's Park. A number of large parks lie outside the city centre, including Hampstead Heath and the remaining Royal Parks of Greenwich Park to the south-east and Bushy Park and Richmond Park (the largest) to the south-west, Hampton Court Park is also a royal park, but, because it contains a palace, it is administered by the Historic Royal Palaces, unlike the eight Royal Parks.Close to Richmond Park is Kew Gardens which has the world's largest collection of living plants. In 2003, the gardens were put on the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites. There are also numerous parks administered by London's borough Councils, including Victoria Park in the East End and Battersea Park in the centre. Some more informal, semi-natural open spaces also exist, including the 320-hectare (790-acre) Hampstead Heath of North London, and Epping Forest, which covers 2,476 hectares (6,118 acres) in the east. Both are controlled by the City of London Corporation. Hampstead Heath incorporates Kenwood House, a former stately home and a popular location in the summer months when classical musical concerts are held by the lake, attracting thousands of people every weekend to enjoy the music, scenery and fireworks.Epping Forest is a popular venue for various outdoor activities, including mountain biking, walking, horse riding, golf, angling, and orienteering.\\n\\n\\n=== Walking ===\\nWalking is a popular recreational activity in London. Areas that provide for walks include Wimbledon Common, Epping Forest, Hampton Court Park, Hampstead Heath, the eight Royal Parks, canals and disused railway tracks. Access to canals and rivers has improved recently, including the creation of the Thames Path, some 28 miles (45 km) of which is within Greater London, and The Wandle Trail; this runs 12 miles (19 km) through South London along the River Wandle, a tributary of the River Thames. Other long distance paths, linking green spaces, have also been created, including the Capital Ring, the Green Chain Walk, London Outer Orbital Path (\\\"Loop\\\"), Jubilee Walkway, Lea Valley Walk, and the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Walk.\\n\\n\\n== Sport ==\\n\\nLondon has hosted the Summer Olympics three times: in 1908, 1948, and 2012. making it the first city to host the modern Games three times. The city was also the host of the British Empire Games in 1934. In 2017, London hosted the World Championships in Athletics for the first time.London's most popular sport is football and it has six clubs in the English Premier League: Arsenal, Chelsea, Crystal Palace, Fulham, Tottenham Hotspur, and West Ham United. Other professional teams in London are Queens Park Rangers, Brentford, Millwall, Charlton Athletic, AFC Wimbledon and Barnet.\\n\\nFrom 1924, the original Wembley Stadium was the home of the English national football team.\\nIt hosted the 1966 FIFA World Cup Final, with England defeating West Germany, and served as the venue for the FA Cup Final as well as rugby league's Challenge Cup final. The new Wembley Stadium serves exactly the same purposes and has a capacity of 90,000.Two Aviva Premiership rugby union teams are based in London, Saracens and Harlequins. London Scottish, London Welsh and London Irish play in the RFU Championship club and other rugby union clubs in the city include Richmond F.C., Rosslyn Park F.C., Westcombe Park R.F.C. and Blackheath F.C.. Twickenham Stadium in south-west London hosts home matches for the England national rugby union team and has a capacity of 82,000 now that the new south stand has been completed.\\n\\nWhile rugby league is more popular in the north of England, there are two professional rugby league clubs in London - the second tier Championship One team, the London Broncos, who play at the Trailfinders Sports Ground in West Ealing, and the third tier League 1 team, the London Skolars from Wood Green, Haringey; in addition, Hemel Stags from Hemel Hempstead north of London also play in League 1.\\nOne of London's best-known annual sports competitions is the Wimbledon Tennis Championships, held at the All England Club in the south-western suburb of Wimbledon. Played in late June to early July, it is the oldest tennis tournament in the world, and widely considered the most prestigious.London has two Test cricket grounds, Lord's (home of Middlesex C.C.C.) in St John's Wood and the Oval (home of Surrey C.C.C.) in Kennington. Lord's has hosted four finals of the Cricket World Cup. Other key events are the annual mass-participation London Marathon, in which some 35,000 runners attempt a 26.2 miles (42.2 km) course around the city, and the University Boat Race on the River Thames from Putney to Mortlake.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\n\\nOutline of London\\nOutline of England\\n\\n\\n== Notes ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n=== Bibliography ===\\nAckroyd, Peter (2001).

He ran his own streaming service named Golf Media; it ran between 2015 to 2018 and contained original scripted series from Okonma himself and the Camp Flog Gnaw Carnival was annually streamed on the service.\\n\\n\\n== Early life ==\\nTyler Gregory Okonma was born on March 6, 1991 in Ladera Heights, California, the son of a Nigerian father of Igbo descent and a mother of mixed African-American and European-Canadian descent. He never met his father and spent his early life living in the communities of Ladera Heights and Hawthorne, California.At the age of seven, he would take the cover out of an album's case and create covers for his own imaginary albums--including a tracklist with song lengths--before he could even make music. At the age of 14, he taught himself to play the piano. In his twelve years of schooling, he attended twelve different schools in the Los Angeles and Sacramento areas.He worked at FedEx for just under two weeks, and Starbucks for over two years. Okonma took his stage name from a MySpace page he used to post his creative endeavors.\\n\\n\\n== Career ==\\n\\n\\n=== 2007-11: Founding of Odd Future, Bastard and Goblin ===\\n\\nOkonma co-founded the alternative hip hop collective Odd Future in 2007, alongside Hodgy, Left Brain and Casey Veggies. They self-released their debut mixtape, The Odd Future Tape, in November 2008. On December 25, 2009, Okonma self-released his first solo mixtape, Bastard. The mixtape was eventually ranked 32nd on Pitchfork Media's list of the Top Albums of 2010. On February 11, 2011, Okonma released the music video for \\\"Yonkers\\\", the first single from his debut studio album, Goblin, which was released May 10, 2011. The video received attention from several online media outlets. An extended version with a third verse was made available on iTunes. Okonma won Best New Artist for \\\"Yonkers\\\" at the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards. Okonma's thematic content in these first two solo projects led fans and publications alike to categorize him in the horrorcore scene, although he vehemently rejected his connection with it.After the release of \\\"Yonkers\\\", Okonma announced that he had signed a one-album deal with British independent label XL Recordings. Okonma and fellow Odd Future member Hodgy Beats made their television debut on February 16, 2011 when they performed \\\"Sandwitches\\\" on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon. On March 16, Okonma and Hodgy performed \\\"Yonkers\\\" and \\\"Sandwitches\\\" at the 2011 mtvU Woodie Awards, being joined by other members of Odd Future during \\\"Sandwitches\\\". During an interview with Okonma for Interview, Waka Flocka Flame expressed his interest in collaborating with the Odd Future frontman to direct a music video for him. In early 2011, Okonma told fans through his Formspring account that his second album would be called Wolf and it was scheduled to be released in May 2012. Okonma also announced that Odd Future would establish their own TV show called Loiter Squad. On September 8, 2011 that the show was finally confirmed as a 15-minute live action show composed of various sketches, man on the street segments, pranks and music made by Odd Future. Dickhouse Productions, the production partnership that created Jackass, was scheduled to produce the show.\\n\\n\\n=== 2012-14: Wolf and Loiter Squad ===\\n\\nOdd Future's television show Loiter Squad premiered on Adult Swim on March 25, 2012. The show ran for three seasons and featured guest appearances from celebrities, including Johnny Knoxville, Lil Wayne and Seth Rogen. In 2015, it Okonma stated that the show \\\"is no more\\\". On February 14, 2013, Odd Future uploaded a video to their YouTube account, which includes L-Boy skydiving and stating that Wolf would be released on April 2, 2013. The same day, Okonma would reveal the three album covers via his Instagram account.\\n \\nIn promotion of Wolf, Okonma performed several guest verses for other artists, notably \\\"Trouble on My Mind\\\" by GOOD Music artist Pusha T, \\\"Martians vs. Goblins by Game (also featuring Lil Wayne), \\\"I'ma Hata\\\" by DJ Drama (also featuring Waka Flocka Flame and D-Bo), the title track from fellow Odd Future member Domo Genesis' collaboration album with The Alchemist, No Idols, and \\\"Blossom & Burn\\\" by Trash Talk (also featuring Hodgy Beats).

It featured guest appearances by Frank Ocean, Mike G, Domo Genesis, Earl Sweatshirt, Left Brain, Hodgy Beats, Pharrell, Casey Veggies and Erykah Badu. The album was produced solely by Okonma, except for the final track \\\"Lone\\\". Along with the lead single \\\"Domo23\\\", music videos were filmed for \\\"Bimmer\\\", \\\"IFHY\\\" and \\\"Jamba\\\". Upon release, the album was met with generally positive reviews and debuted at number three on the Billboard 200, selling 90,000 copies in its first week.\\nOn January 31, 2014, Okonma was reported to be recording with Mac DeMarco.\\n\\n\\n=== 2015-16: Cherry Bomb ===\\n\\nOn April 9, 2015, Okonma released the music video for the song \\\"Fucking Young\\\" to Odd Future's official YouTube channel. The video also included a short snippet of another song, \\\"Deathcamp\\\". Okonma announced on the same day that the songs will be featured on his upcoming album Cherry Bomb, set for release on April 13, 2015. Okonma announced via his Twitter account that the album would feature Charlie Wilson, Chaz Bundick and  Black Lips member Cole Alexander. Two days later, Okonma performed the songs \\\"Fucking Young\\\" and \\\"Deathcamp\\\" for the first time at Coachella. During the set, Okonma notably criticized VIP members in the audience, of which many were celebrities, for their lack of enthusiasm.Cherry Bomb was released digitally on April 13, 2015, through Odd Future Records, with physical copies of the album, featuring five different album covers, set to be released on April 28, 2015. The album features performances from notable artists such as Kanye West, Lil Wayne and Schoolboy Q. The album was supported by a world tour through North America, Europe and Asia, beginning at Coachella music festival on April 11, 2015 and ending in Tokyo, Japan in September 2015. Okonma cancelled the Australian leg of his Cherry Bomb World Tour following a campaign by the grassroots organization Collective Shout against the portrayal of women in his music.On August 26, 2015, Okonma revealed that he had been banned from visiting the United Kingdom for three to five years, which forced him to cancel a string of tour dates supporting the Cherry Bomb album, including the Reading and Leeds Festivals. The reason for the ban comes from lyrics dating back to 2009. His manager Christian Clancy said they were informed of the ban via a letter from then-Home Secretary Theresa May. May cited lyrics from the mixtape Bastard as the reason for the ban, although Okonma had toured multiple times in the UK since its release. Okonma later claimed that he felt he had been treated \\\"like a terrorist\\\" and implied that the ban was racially motivated, stating that \\\"they did not like the fact that their children were idolising a black man\\\".\\n\\n\\n=== 2017-present: Flower Boy, new TV shows, and WANGSAP ===\\n\\nOn April 8, 2017, Frank Ocean released a song titled \\\"Biking\\\" on his Beats One radio station \\\"blonded RADIO\\\", which features both Tyler, the Creator and Jay Z. Eight days later it was announced Okonma would write, produce, and perform the theme song for scientist Bill Nye's new show, Bill Nye Saves the World.\\nOn June 28, the trailer for Okonma's TV show Nuts + Bolts premiered on Viceland. The show focuses on things Tyler, the Creator finds interesting or is passionate about, and explains how they are created. The series premiered on August 3, 2017.On June 29, 2017, Okonma released the song \\\"Who Dat Boy\\\" featuring ASAP Rocky on a new YouTube channel, following many promotional countdown posts on his social media accounts. Later that night, he released the song on streaming services alongside a new song titled \\\"911 / Mr. Lonely\\\" featuring Steve Lacy, Frank Ocean, and Anna of the North. On July 6, 2017, he announced the title, tracklist and release date of his fourth album, Flower Boy, which was released on July 21, 2017. Several singles were released following up to the album's release date, including \\\"Boredom\\\" and \\\"I Ain't Got Time!\\\". The album was released via iTunes, Spotify, and other major music services. On September 14, 2017, Tyler, the Creator announced his third TV show to date, The Jellies. It premiered on October 22, 2017. Flower Boy received rave reviews from critics and was nominated for Best Rap Album at the 60th Annual Grammy Awards, giving Tyler his second Grammy nomination after contributing to 2013 Album of the Year nominee Channel Orange, but was beat out by Kendrick Lamar's fourth studio album Damn.\\nOn March 29, 2018, Okonma released \\\"Okra\\\", amongst a string of freestyles and remixes. Okonma referred to it as a \\\"throwaway song\\\", stating that it was not going to be included on any upcoming album, and was not an indication of the sound of any future projects. On May 22, 2018, he released \\\"435\\\", continuing this string of singles. On July 23, 2018, Okonma and ASAP Rocky announced a collaborative project, WANGSAP, by releasing a music video for a remix of Monica's \\\"Knock Knock\\\" named \\\"Potato Salad\\\" on \\\"AWGE DVD (Vol. 3)\\\", a video compilation by AWGE, ASAP Rocky's creative agency.\\n\\n\\n== Artistry ==\\nOkonma is widely considered to be the leader of Odd Future, and the group as a whole has been compared to the influential hip hop group Wu Tang Clan. Since the beginning of his career, Okonma has largely self-produced songs for his projects and other Odd Future members. Over the years, his style of production has progressed from gritty and dark in early projects to a more jazzy and soulful approach with the albums Cherry Bomb and Flower Boy. His lyrical themes have also evolved from horrorcore-esque subjects to views on love, sexuality, existence and nostalgia. Musically, he has been heavily influenced by N.E.R.D and The Neptunes member Pharrell Williams. Williams' debut solo album In My Mind had a substantial impact on Okonma, inspiring him to co-found the Odd Future collective. He has also cited N.E.R.D's debut album In Search of...  as an impactful album for him.\\n\\n\\n== Controversies ==\\nOkonma has been criticized for his use of homophobic slurs, in particular, his frequent use of the epithet \\\"faggot\\\" in his lyrics and on Twitter. He has denied accusations of homophobia, stating, \\\"I'm not homophobic. I just say faggot and use gay as an adjective to describe stupid shit,\\\" and, \\\"I'm not homophobic. I just think faggot hits and hurts people.\\\" However, he later said in an interview with MTV about the slurs, \\\"Well, I have gay fans and they don't really take it offensive, so I don't know. If it offends you, it offends you. If you call me a nigger, I really don't care, but that's just me, personally. Some people might take it the other way; I personally don't give a shit.\\\" Despite making several remarks that have been taken as homophobic, Tyler, the Creator was among the first to openly support fellow Odd Future member Frank Ocean after publicly revealing a past relationship with another young man.Okonma has also been criticized for his graphic depictions of violence against women and his allegedly misogynistic lyrics. Brent DiCrescenzo of Time Out Chicago writes that rape is a \\\"predominant theme\\\" of Goblin and Hermione Hoby of The Guardian writes that Okonma's \\\"rape and murder fantasies (are) graphic enough to send the vomit rising along with the bile.\\\" The Fader tallied 68 uses of the term \\\"bitch\\\" over Goblin's 73 minutes. Responding to Canadian indie pop duo Tegan and Sara's criticism of his lyrics, Okonma tweeted: \\\"If Tegan and Sara need some hard dick, hit me up!\\\"On March 15, 2014, Okonma was arrested for inciting a riot after having shouted to fans to push their way past \\nsecurity guards at a sold-out show at the South by Southwest music festival.On August 26, 2015, Okonma revealed that he had been banned from visiting the United Kingdom for three to five years, which forced him to cancel a string of tour dates supporting the Cherry Bomb album, including the Reading and Leeds Festivals. The reason for the ban comes from lyrics dating back to 2009. His manager Christian Clancy said they were informed of the ban via a letter from then-Home Secretary Theresa May. May cited lyrics from the mixtape Bastard as the reason for the ban, although Okonma had toured multiple times in the UK since its release. Okonma later claimed that he felt he had been treated \\\"like a terrorist\\\" and implied that the ban was racially motivated, stating that \\\"they did not like the fact that their children were idolising a black man\\\".A series of three commercials for Mountain Dew directed by Okonma created controversy in May 2013, accused  of using \\\"racial stereotypes\\\" and \\\"making light of violence against women\\\". In the spots an energy drink-loving goat character called \\\"Felicia the Goat\\\" is consecutively being \\\"scapegoated\\\" in a diner, in prison and on the road. During the 60-second ad in prison, a battered white woman on crutches examines a police line-up consisting of several African American men and one goat, while the goat antagonizes the woman. Syracuse professor and social critic Boyce Watkins stated that the ad was \\\"arguably the most racist commercial in history\\\". PepsiCo pulled the ad and apologized. Okonma released a statement claiming that the ad was not meant to \\\"spark a controversy about race\\\" and that \\\"it was simply an, again, admittedly absurd story that was never meant to be taken seriously.\\\"\\n\\n\\n== Personal life ==\\n\\nOkonma has identified as an atheist and has had explicitly anti-religious lyrics in his music, especially on the albums Bastard and Goblin, and has also said some things that suggest he is an agnostic atheist.Okonma has a love for skateboards and bicycles.Lyrics on the album Flower Boy led to speculation that Okonma was coming out as gay. The tracks in question were \\\"Foreword\\\", \\\"Garden Shed\\\", and \\\"I Ain't Got Time!\\\" Okonma further fuelled the discussion when he seemingly revealed in an August 2017 interview that he had a boyfriend when he was 15 years old, though he later tweeted that it was a figure of speech.\\n\\n\\n== Discography ==\\n\\nMixtapes\\n\\nBastard (2009)Studio albums\\n\\nGoblin (2011)\\nWolf (2013)\\nCherry Bomb (2015)\\nFlower Boy (2017)Collaboration albums\\n\\nThe Odd Future Tape (2008) (with Odd Future)\\nRadical (2010) (with Odd Future)\\nThe OF Tape Vol. 2 (2012) (with Odd Future)\\nWANG$AP (2018/2019) (with A$AP Rocky)\\n\\n\\n== Filmography ==\\n\\n\\n=== As director ===\\n\\n\\n==== Music videos ====\\n\\n\\n== Awards and nominations ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\n Media related to Tyler, the Creator at Wikimedia Commons\", \"rev_id\": 857666129, \"accessed\": \"2018-09-03 00:23:59.864295\", \"links\": [\"Adult Swim\", \"RED Distribution\", \"Starbucks\", \"No Idols\", \"African American\", \"Jasper Dolphin\", \"FedEx\", \"DJ Drama\", \"Domo Genesis\", \"Kendrick Lamar\", \"Sandwitches\", \"Black Lips\", \"Who Dat Boy\", \"Wu Tang Clan\", \"Damn (Kendrick Lamar album)\", \"She (Tyler, the Creator song)\", \"YouTube\", \"MellowHype\", \"Okra (song)\", \"Domo23\", \"South by Southwest\", \"Casey Veggies\", \"MTV Video Music Awards\", \"Bastard (Tyler, the Creator album)\", \"Hawthorne, California\", \"Hodgy\", \"Goblin (album)\", \"Formspring\", \"XL Recordings\", \"Golf Wang\", \"The Neptunes\", \"Best Rap Album\", \"Biking (Frank Ocean song)\", \"Bill Nye\", \"Trouble on My Mind\", \"911 / Mr. Lonely\", \"Taco Bennett\", \"Pharrell\", \"Billboard (magazine)\", \"In Search of...

At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 70, based on six reviews.

Mac Miller figures into the great \\\"Coming Back\\\", but the bits about Domo's family, his autistic brother, and his own search for self make this a meatier album than expected.\\\" Keith Nelson Jr. of HipHopDX said, \\\"It's the subtle sequencing--deliberate to show his progression--that elevates the project from merely a delinquent to being the tale of a reformed man.\\\" Sheldon Pearce of Pitchfork said, \\\"Sometimes the hooks on Genesis get wonky, there are portions of the record that feel unfinished (like the second half of \\\"Wanderer\\\"), and every now and then Domo will sneak in a groaner. But for the most part, Genesis is a revelation.\\\" Ebyan Abdigir of Exclaim! said, \\\"Domo's Genesis is a step in the right direction, but he's walking to his destination, and not anywhere near where he needs to be just yet.\\\" Brian Tabb of Pretty Much Amazing said, \\\"The sparks of great art are there, but the brain behind the creation lays dormant.

The song in question eventually became \\\"Thinking About You\\\", which Kelly commented; \\\"it's sort of a vulnerable track and I wanted everyone to feel me on it.\\\" On July 28, 2011, Ocean leaked his demo version of the song onto his tumblr account, with the title stylized as \\\"Thinking Bout You\\\". The song was then promptly taken down by Ocean. Kelly, who had already performed an acoustic version of the song, retitled her version \\\"Thinking About Forever\\\" following the release of Ocean's version. Kelly's version found its way onto her debut EP Every Girl (2011). Kelly was ultimately fine with Ocean's decision, however she noted that she didn't like how most people thought Ocean's version was the original, and how people assumed her version was a cover version. About the confusion of the track, Kelly stated\\n\\nNow that push has come to shove, we're going to let the song have a life of its own. I think it's an amazing, well-written record. Frank Ocean is incredibly talented, I will never say anything against that. But at the same time, you know, he's going to do what he wants to do, he's an artist as well.\\nOcean later stated why he chose to release his own version of the song, stating that it was still extremely personal to him. On March 8, 2012, a re-mastered version of the song premiered on IHeartRadio, intended to be the lead single from Ocean's debut album. At a listening party in June 2012, it was confirmed that the track would appear on Ocean's Channel Orange, which was released on July 17, 2012. The version of the track eventually featured on the album was remodified for a second time, this time to include additional strings and further remastered production. It was released as a digital download on April 17, 2012. The song was subsequently released to mainstream radio in the United States on January 29, 2013.\\n\\n\\n== Composition ==\\n\\\"Thinkin Bout You\\\" is an R&B song with an atmospheric beat. The track is a tender ballad that \\\"retains Ocean's signature mellow, minimalist vibe,\\\" reinforced with shimmering synths and silky production. Ocean croons smoothly on the song, while employing a falsetto vocal range in certain sections. MTV columnist Jenna Hally Rubenstein likens Ocean's singing on \\\"Thinkin Bout You\\\" to Robin Thicke, Justin Timberlake, and Maxwell. The version of the song featured on Channel Orange features an additional string section, opening the track with a swell of strings.Lyrically, \\\"it's a melancholy record discussing the torturous pain that comes with thinking about someone all the time, even if they may not reciprocate the sentiment.\\\" The track, being originally written for a woman, can be viewed as unisex composition. Following Ocean's revelation that he has been attracted to people of the same sex, some critics noted that lines such as \\\"my eyes don't shed tears, but boy they pour when I'm thinkin bout you\\\" had another additional message, expressing his own thoughts on love. The song has been called a forbidden love track, expressing Ocean's turmoil about his own hidden sexuality. The refrain \\\"boy\\\" was originally viewed synonym for \\\"wow\\\", though \\\"new urgency\\\" was pumped into the track, adding extra pathos. Ocean reminisces about his \\\"first time\\\", with an ex-lover who is addressed as \\\"boy\\\" during the song. The track is an apology to an unnamed lover. Lines like \\\"a tornado flew around my room before you came,\\\" serves as a confession, and \\\"excuse the mess it made, it usually doesn't rain in Southern California\\\" outlines Ocean's own grief about the situation, admitting the situation got out of control.About Ocean's writing, Pitchfork Media's Jordan Sargent stated that the \\\"strength of his songwriting is his ability to make the unfamiliar feel intensely personal, as if you're a friend that has long known all the particulars of his relationships.\\\" He continued, \\\"Thinking About You\\\" is also more primal, though. The yearning in his falsetto is almost palpable as he flips gender roles and admits that he's been \\\"thinking about forever,\\\" while simultaneously questioning if the \\\"girl\\\" even had that kinda thing on her mind.\\\" Erika Ramirez of Billboard wrote that the track \\\"gives prominence to his songwriting prowess and sonic versatility, as he intertwines the parallel styles of soul, R&B, jazz and even a bit of funk.\\\" The song has been described as incredibly personal in nature, the \\\"sort of thing that's best sung by the person who wrote it.\\\" The track telepathically serenades the person who took Ocean's virginity, and in the \\\"motel room of memories Frank talks eternal love, breaking into a sublime Maxwell-esque falsetto that makes a good case for restoring the style to contemporary mainstream R&B.\\\"\\n\\n\\n== Critical reception ==\\n\\\"Thinkin Bout You\\\" received highly positive reviews from music critics. Pitchfork Media called the song \\\"bewitching\\\" and complimented its crossover potential. Sputnikmusic's Sobhi Youssef praised the track, commenting that Ocean's ability to \\\"emote within the confines of a ballad without making it saccharine or cheesy is nearly unparalleled by any of his contemporaries\\\", citing \\\"Thinkin Bout You\\\" as the framework of most of the album. Pitchfork Media critic Jordan Sargent praised the song, and wrote \\\"this isn't a tale of bedroom triumph; instead it's a beguiling sketch of a relationship just out of his reach. Like many of his songs, the magnetism of \\\"Thinking About You\\\" lies not in the details, but in the lack thereof.\\\" Billboard stated that the \\\"Odd Future member tries out different singing styles, showing off his beautiful falsetto vocal range in certain sections.\\\" MTV journalist Jenna Hally commented that Ocean had a \\\"surprisingly gorgeous falsetto\\\" and \\\"retains Frank's classic laid-back and relaxed R&B vibe.\\\" Katherine Asaph of Popdust wrote that the track \\\"might as well be Ocean's final audition for R&B stardom\\\" and that it was a \\\"smooth ballad version of \\\"Novacane\\\" without the sleaze getting in the way of its purpose is just about the best thing possible for Ocean's burgeoning fame. The track shatters no earth, and nobody will use it as a (flawed) example about how Ocean's changing the R&B game, but in everyone's career is a time for a solid ballad.\\\"John Calvert of The Quietus described \\\"Thinkin Bout You\\\" as a \\\"slow-release torch song the colour of caramel and bathed in low voltage lighting, a buzzing but soothing synth cycle and muffled beats evoke touching and kissing in a velveteen womb. Poised, considered, classy and moving, this is uniquely Frank Ocean.\\\" Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune stated that the track \\\"couldn't be any less auspicious as an opening song, little more than a delicate, yearning falsetto vocal over vaporous keyboards and a muffled rhythm track.\\\" Rolling Stone writer Jody Rosen described the song as \\\"woozy\\\", featuring Ocean's \\\"falsetto rippling over murmuring electronic percussion\\\". She stated that \\\"it's a bisexual black bohemian New Orleanian-turned-Angeleno's avant-R&B torch ballad. And, of course, it's just a love song - an anthem for anyone, anywhere, who's found love, and lost it.\\\"Hayley Louise Brown of Clash viewed the song as an important part of the album, musing \\\"opening with a reworked version of heartbreaking ballad 'Thinking About You' and an instant confrontation with the full force of Ocean's vocal range, the whole record echoes with extra terrestrial Odd Future synths and clumsy piano chords.\\\" Lane Billings of Paste noted the song as whispy in nature, and made a case for Ocean as an R&B revivalist. Consequence of Sound's Harley Brown of stated that the song moves languidly, \\\"like perfect thoughts about someone missed, until the muscle memory of Ocean's falsetto bursts into the song's upper register.\\\" She continued, \\\"while Ocean might feel this more acutely than either woman who sung those songs, there's a reason Bey shed a tear the first time she heard it. Regardless of how much these lyrics were influenced by lines like, 'By the time I realized I was in love, it was malignant. It was hopeless,' the ache in Ocean's voice is universal. MSN Music's Danielle Cheesman felt that Ocean did his followers a service by featuring the song as the album's opener, describing the track as\\\" the year-old spacey serenade to a boy that became a fan favorite.\\\" She continued, \\\"despite now being enhanced with a strings intro, his falsetto - more importantly - remains in tact over the well-known warped ebb and flow.\\\"\\n\\n\\n=== Accolades ===\\nRolling Stone named the song the 4th best song of 2012, calling it \\\"the year's deepest love song [that] won us all.\\\"  Complex named the track the fourth best song of 2011, writing that \\\"Ocean's voice explores those awkward spaces in a new relationship, making the eternal lover's questions sound new and urgent. Whatever it is, Frank Ocean's \\\"Thinking About Forever\\\" is one of those songs that will never get old.\\\" Beyonce reportedly cried while listening to the song, and wrote Ocean a poem of support. Knowles and Ocean had previously collaborated on the track \\\"I Miss You\\\". The Village Voice's Pazz & Jop annual critics' poll ranked \\\"Thinkin Bout You\\\" at number four to find the best music of 2012.\\n\\n\\n== Music video ==\\n\\nOn September 15, 2011, a music video directed by visual art group High5Collective was released. The Direction team's \\\"music videos are typically unofficial affair\\\" but according to them the clip was the official video. Pitchfork Media reported, \\\"it sure looks official, since Frank seems to appear in the bloody, somewhat tragic clip (in doctor's garb), and Frank posted it on his Tumblr.\\\" It featured Native American cultural imagery and interdimensional elements in its plot. The music video plays out \\\"more like a short film than something you'd see on MTV Jams, this visionary piece sees the OFWGKTA crooner play merely a supporting cast role as a doctor. Ocean makes a cameo as a doctor, though \\\"mostly with the back of his head, his footage refreshingly entwined with a girl-saving Native American mystical ritual.\\\" The video explores the dreams of a sick girl, a \\\"few primitive zombie-looking people\\\", and some \\\"celestial activity.\\\"The Huffington Post wrote that \\\"the video is a dream within a story involving a little girl, a teepee and a few deaths. Cool! It's a surprisingly filmic effort, with a sepia mid-century creepiness that calls to mind \\\"Mad Men\\\" plus \\\"Justified,\\\" with a little \\\"Walking Dead\\\" thrown in for good measure.\\\" The Smoking Section commented, \\\"he premise might sound out there, until you watch for yourself and your assumptions become trumped by the visually and mentally stimulating succession of supernatural events.\\\" Prefix Magazine gave the video a positive review, writing \\\"the vid sets Ocean's doe-eyed crooning against something of an inter-dimensional love story, that or a dreamcatcher-inspired fever dream. Either way, pioneer triage and white-eyed shaman were not what we we're expecting, but we couldn't be more pleasantly surprised.\\\"\\n\\n\\n== Promotion ==\\nOcean embarked on a solo tour through North America and Europe to promote his mixtape Nostalgia Ultra and his other musical projects. The set lists to the various shows varied, though \\\"Thinking Bout You\\\" was performed at all shows. The track was included during Ocean's setlist at the April 2012 Coachella Musical Festival. Complex magazine stated the \\\"his falsetto on \\\"Thinking About You\\\" made women in the audience swoon.\\\" Ocean later performed the song at the 2012 MTV Video Music Awards.Electronic artist SBTRKT released a remixed version of the track onto his own personal SoundCloud account, announcing \\\"did this whilst on tour...not mixed or official\\\". Pop artists Justin Bieber and Jaden Smith recorded a cover version of the track. MTV reported, \\\"in his smooth, pop and R&B way Justin fantasizes about Selena Gomez delivers Frank's sexy verse like a boss: \\\"Do you not think so far ahead?/'Cause I've been thinking 'bout forever.\\\" American singer ZZ Ward performed a version of the song in April 2013 for The A.V. Club's A.V. Undercover series.\\n\\n\\n== Chart performance ==\\nOn the week of March 22, 2012, the song debuted at number 91 on Billboard's Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs. It has since peaked at number 7. Following the release of Channel Orange, the track rode a wave of momentum and charted at position 32 on the Billboard Hot 100, 6 on the Billboard Heatseekers Songs chart, 94 on the UK Singles Chart and 16 on the UK R&B singles chart. On December 14, 2012, \\\"Thinkin Bout You\\\" was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), for shipments of 500,000 units in the United States. As of February 28, 2013, the song has sold over one million copies in the United States.\\n\\n\\n== Charts ==\\n\\n\\n== Certifications ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nLyrics of this song at MetroLyrics\", \"rev_id\": 847830587, \"accessed\": \"2018-09-03 00:23:59.864295\", \"links\": [\"MetroLyrics\", \"Billboard (magazine)\", \"MTV\", \"I Miss You (Beyonc\\u00e9 Knowles song)\", \"Novacane (song)\", \"Nostalgia Ultra\", \"Paste (magazine)\", \"Rolling Stone\", \"Consequence of Sound\", \"North America\", \"Jaden Smith\", \"Single (music)\", \"Sputnikmusic\", \"Thinking About You (disambiguation)\", \"Justin Timberlake\", \"Chicago Tribune\", \"Greg Kot\", \"Clash (magazine)\", \"Bridget Kelly\", \"Shea Taylor\", \"The A.V.

In an interview with Respect Mag, Casey stated it as: \\\"It's hard to explain, really, but I just had more of a [different] vision for my own rap career. I wanted to do my own thing.\\\" While working with a fellow rapper and Def Jam's recording artist YG on his second mixtape, Veggies began to take rap much more seriously. In an interview with The Madbury Club, Veggies discussed how \\\"strategic sponsorships, limited merchandise, organic partnerships, social presence and influence ability have proved fundamental in the success of Peas & Carats and thus, Casey Veggies\\\".After graduating high school, Veggies joined with Mac Miller, as one of the opening act for his Blue Slide Park Tour.

He said if people wanted \\\"the full thing\\\" they would have to give him 50,000 followers on Twitter. He later confirmed on his new Twitter account that he had returned to his home in Los Angeles. Three hours later, Sweatshirt reached 50,000 followers and released a new song on his website, entitled \\\"Home\\\", which ends with \\\"...and I'm back. Bye.\\\" Sweatshirt later said via Twitter that all the songs released prior to Oldie were old songs that he recorded before going abroad. On the same day Earl launched his website Terttlefer.com, which was later changed to Earlxsweat.com (after his Twitter username), and finally Earlsweatshirt.com. On May 2, 2012, Sweatshirt created his own record label imprint called Tan Cressida, which will be distributed through Columbia Records. He turned down several larger offers due to his priority of remaining close to Odd Future.On November 12, 2012, Earl announced on his Twitter account that his first and second studio albums titled Doris and Gnossos. Doris was reported to feature vocals or production from Tyler, the Creator, Frank Ocean, Om'Mas Keith, Thundercat, Domo Genesis, The Neptunes, Christian Rich, Vince Staples, BadBadNotGood, Pharrell Williams, Samiyam, The Alchemist, Casey Veggies and The Internet.On March 6, 2013, while performing with Flying Lotus and Mac Miller, Earl premiered three new songs off Doris, \\\"Burgundy\\\" produced by The Neptunes, \\\"Hive\\\" featuring Casey Veggies and Vince Staples, and \\\"Guild\\\" featuring Mac Miller. At Coachella 2013 Earl presented \\\"Hive\\\", \\\"Burgundy\\\", and \\\"Guild\\\", as well as \\\"20 Wave Caps\\\". At Syracuse, he previewed \\\"Molasses\\\" featuring RZA of the Wu-Tang Clan. On July 12, 2013, Earl announced that the album would be released on August 20, 2013, and released the album cover and track listing.\\n\\n\\n== Recording ==\\nSweatshirt worked with The Neptunes and Chicago producers Christian Rich for the track \\\"Burgundy\\\". Taiwo of Christian Rich revealed to MTV News that Pharrell Williams spent most of the day working on Robin Thicke's smash hit \\\"Blurred Lines\\\", but took a short break to work on \\\"Burgundy\\\" with his Neptunes' partner, Chad Hugo. The song title does not appear in the lyrics, but is a reference to Earl's grandmother's Burgundy carpet. The song contains a sample from Preacher's \\\"The Power of the Truth\\\".The album's lead single \\\"Chum\\\" was produced by production duo Christian Rich. Sweatshirt had heard of the two before, and the duo met with Sony's A&R staff for Sweatshirt to hear their beats. Sweatshirt's first album Doris was produced over the course of about four or five months, and \\\"Chum\\\" was created on its first three days of making the LP. The song was produced using Logic Pro, and the beat was the quickest and rawest made on the album. The song was recorded by Julian Prindle at Paramount Recording Studios in Hollywood, California. Jaycen Joshua mixed the track at Larrabee Sound Studios in North Hollywood (Where Justin Timberlake recorded The 20/20 Experience and The 20/20 Experience - 2 of 2), and it was later mastered by Dave Kutch at the Mastering Palace in New York City (Where The Roots recorded their 2011 album Undun). Taiwo Hassan wrote the chorus for \\\"Chum\\\", and Sweatshirt came up with the verses. The song's instrumentation consists of a tumbling piano loop, a low-octave, fuzzy bass, drums, vocals, and other sampled sounds. Christian Rich originally considered Thom Yorke to perform the hook to make it sound bigger, but Sweatshirt refused, as he didn't want to go for that sound.\\\"Sunday\\\" features fellow Odd Future member Frank Ocean. The song is seen as unusual for Ocean who is renowned for his singing rather than his rapping, having previously only shown off his rapping on the track \\\"Blue Whale\\\" (Which was leaked online) and The OF Tape Vol. 2 closer \\\"Oldie\\\". The duo had previously collaborated on Ocean's \\\"Super Rich Kids\\\" from Ocean's 2012 album Channel Orange. The song raised minor controversy regarding Ocean's verse which included lyrics regarding Ocean's reported feud with Chris Brown in which Ocean and Brown reportedly brawled. Though the song title doesn't appear in the lyrics, Ocean and Brown's parking lot scuffle happened on a Sunday. The song went through many different incarnations and mixes before being completed. The original version was lost after his laptop's hard drive crashed. After reassembling it, the rapper decided that he hated the mixes. \\\"Then it was, 'We can't mix this song,\\\"' he told NME, '\\\"...you're going to have to redo it or do a new song.' I threw a tantrum. I did a new song.\\\"\\\"Hive\\\" was written, recorded, produced, and engineered in the living room of Syd tha Kyd and Matt Martians' old home in Marina del Rey, California; the music was programmed in Reason. The song took three hours to record, with Sweatshirt's verse recorded in only one take before Casey Veggies and Vince Staples did theirs. Martians said that Sweatshirt \\\"works quickly in general: he gets his initial ideas out quickly, then goes back and makes adjustments. That's a mature thing about his music-making. He knows what he wants to do and what kinds of feelings he wants to convey.\\\" The track was later mixed by Jaycen Joshua at Larrabee Sound Studios in North Hollywood, California, and mastered by Dave Kutch at the Mastering Palace in New York City.\\n\\n\\n== Promotion ==\\n \\nThe album's lead single, \\\"Chum\\\", was released on November 1, 2012. The music video for \\\"Chum\\\" was released on December 4, 2012. The album's second single, \\\"Whoa\\\" featuring Tyler, the Creator, was released on March 12, 2013, along with the music video being released, which was directed by Tyler, the Creator. The album's third single, \\\"Hive\\\" featuring Vince Staples and Casey Veggies, was released on July 16, 2013, as well an accompanying music video was then released later that day.From April 30 through May 18, 2013, Earl Sweatshirt toured the West Coast of the United States with Tyler, the Creator on his tour for Wolf. On August 9, 2013, Sweatshirt made his national television debut, performing The Neptunes-produced \\\"Burgundy\\\" on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon. On September 10, 2013, Earl Sweatshirt announced his first solo-headlining concert tour titled Doris. The tour ran from October 6 through November 9, 2013, and featured supporting acts by Hodgy Beats, Domo Genesis and Vince Staples.\\n\\n\\n== Critical reception ==\\nDoris received widespread acclaim from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 82, based on 32 reviews. William Gruger of Billboard said, \\\"What follows is Doris, a slow (rarely rising above 70 bpm), introspective album where Earl Sweatshirt combats pressures when returning to a life of stardom after time spent at a Samoa-based boarding school for troubled youths.\\\" Ben Beaumont-Thomas of The Guardian said, \\\"This is knockabout punchline rap made into high art, a psychedelic visionquest to the taqueria on a skateboard.\\\" Randall Roberts of Los Angeles Times said, \\\"Doris features instrumental interludes, expanded mid-song diversions and enough surprise to warrant repeated--obsessive--evaluation.\\\" Jesse Fairfax of HipHopDX said, \\\"Where he has yet to master the art of making complete songs (\\\"Uncle Al\\\" clocks in under a minute long) and his diction tends to lacks clarity, Earl paints pictures in a manner more poetic than just about all within his peer group.\\\" Kevin Ritchie of Now said, \\\"Despite all the gifted-beyond-his-years hype, that over-arching concerns still feel inextricably teenaged, albeit precociously so.\\\"Simon Vozick-Levinson of Rolling Stone said, \\\"His rhyme schemes are as complex as ever, and these resolutely unpop beats - sticky-icky sample collages from producers including Pharrell, RZA and himself - are an ideal canvas. But his subject matter has undergone a drastic overhaul. Unlike some peers, Earl has figured out that shock value only goes so far.\\\" David Jeffries of AllMusic said, \\\"Doris is unsettled, messy, and takes a bit to sort, but there are codes to crack and rich rewards to reap, so enter with an open mind and prepare to leave exhausted.\\\" Aaron Matthews of Exclaim! said, \\\"Doris isn't the classic many anticipated, but it is a strong, uncompromised debut from a very talented young rapper. For now, that's enough.\\\" Michael Madden of Consequence of Sound said, \\\"It's a work as notable for its technical achievements as its nuanced themes, and that's almost as impressive considering that so many artists lack in one or both of those fields.\\\" Kevin Perry of NME said, \\\"He doesn't want to be a powerhouse rap star. Doris may alienate people looking for him to be that. For everyone else, this is a powerful record.\\\"Darryl G. Wright of PopMatters said, \\\"Doris represents one of the most innovative and important hip-hop releases of the year. Not just because of the charm and intrigue of Earl's story but because of the immense and understated level of his talent for writing rhymes.\\\" Craig Jenkins of Pitchfork said, \\\"As comebacks go, it's shockingly insular and unassuming. Even when he skirts the mainstream, he does so with cautious optimism.\\\" Jesse Cataldo of Slant Magazine said, \\\"Earl may be one of the quieter voices on Doris, but his dense, evocative sensibility dominates the album both lyrically and musically.\\\" Dan Jackson of XXL said, \\\"As one might expect from a 19-year-old, this is an album of extremes. It can be poignant and honest in one moment, then cagey and distant in the next.\\\" Julianne Escobedo Shepherd of Spin said, \\\"The record is at its best when he simply shifts into verbal overdrive, spitting gnarled bullets on the phenomenal robber's fable \\\"Centurion\\\" or the weedy hallucinogen \\\"Guild\\\".\\\" Evan Rytlewski of The A.V. Club said, \\\"It often feels less like a finished work than a sketchbook, a jumble of beats and raps (about half of them from guests) with little in the way of hooks, choruses, or general songcraft to tie them together.\\\"\\n\\n\\n=== Accolades ===\\nClosing out the year, Doris was named to multiple \\\"Album of the Year\\\" lists for 2013.

Cowboy later worked the \\\"hip hop\\\" cadence into his stage performance. The group frequently performed with disco artists who would refer to this new type of music by calling them \\\"hip hoppers.\\\" The name was originally meant as a sign of disrespect but soon came to identify this new music and culture.The song \\\"Rapper's Delight\\\" by The Sugarhill Gang, released in 1979, begins with the phrase \\\"I said a hip, hop the hippie the hippie to the hip hip hop, and you don't stop\\\". Lovebug Starski -- a Bronx DJ who put out a single called \\\"The Positive Life\\\" in 1981 -- and DJ Hollywood then began using the term when referring to this new disco rap music. Bill Alder, an independent consultant, once said, \\\"There was hardly ever a moment when rap music was underground, one of the very first so-called rap records, was a monster hit (\\\"Rapper's Delight\\\" by the Sugar Hill Gang on Sugarhill Records). Hip hop pioneer and South Bronx community leader Afrika Bambaataa also credits Lovebug Starski as the first to use the term \\\"hip hop\\\" as it relates to the culture. Bambaataa, former leader of the Black Spades, also did much to further popularize the term. The words \\\"hip hop\\\" first appeared in print on September 21, 1982, in The Village Voice in a profile of Bambaataa written by Steven Hager, who also published the first comprehensive history of the culture with St. Martins' Press.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\n\\n=== 1970s ===\\n\\nIn the 1970s, an underground urban movement known as \\\"hip hop\\\" began to develop in the Bronx, New York City. It focused on emceeing (or MCing) over \\\"breakbeats,\\\" house parties and neighborhood block party events, held outdoors. Hip hop music has been a powerful medium for protesting the impact of legal institutions on minorities, particularly police and prisons. Historically, hip hop arose out of the ruins of a post-industrial and ravaged South Bronx, as a form of expression of urban Black and Latino youth, whom the public and political discourse had written off as marginalized communities. Jamaican-born DJ Clive \\\"Kool Herc\\\" Campbell pioneered the use of DJing percussion \\\"breaks\\\" in hip hop music. Beginning at Herc's home in a high-rise apartment at 1520 Sedgwick Avenue, the movement later spread across the entire borough. On August 11, 1973 DJ Kool Herc was the DJ at his sister's back-to-school party. He extended the beat of a record by using two record players, isolating the percussion \\\"breaks\\\" by using a mixer to switch between the two records. Herc's experiments with making music with record players became what we now know as breaking or \\\"scratching.\\\"A second key musical element in hip hop music is emceeing (also called MCing or rapping). Emceeing is the rhythmic spoken delivery of rhymes and wordplay, delivered at first without accompaniment and later done over a beat. This spoken style was influenced by the African American style of \\\"capping,\\\" a performance where men tried to outdo each other in originality of their language and tried to gain the favor of the listeners. The basic elements of hip hop--boasting raps, rival \\\"posses\\\" (groups), uptown \\\"throw-downs,\\\" and political and social commentary--were all long present in African American music. MCing and rapping performers moved back and forth between the predominance of toasting songs packed with a mix of boasting, 'slackness' and sexual innuendo and a more topical, political, socially conscious style. The role of the MC originally was as a Master of Ceremonies for a DJ dance event. The MC would introduce the DJ and try to pump up the audience. The MC spoke between the DJ's songs, urging everyone to get up and dance. MCs would also tell jokes and use their energetic language and enthusiasm to rev up the crowd. Eventually, this introducing role developed into longer sessions of spoken, rhythmic wordplay, and rhyming, which became rapping.\\nBy 1979 hip hop music had become a mainstream genre. It spread across the world in the 1990s with controversial \\\"gangsta\\\" rap. Herc also developed upon break-beat deejaying, where the breaks of funk songs--the part most suited to dance, usually percussion-based--were isolated and repeated for the purpose of all-night dance parties. This form of music playback, using hard funk and rock, formed the basis of hip hop music. Campbell's announcements and exhortations to dancers would lead to the syncopated, rhymed spoken accompaniment now known as rapping. He dubbed his dancers \\\"break-boys\\\" and \\\"break-girls,\\\" or simply b-boys and b-girls. According to Herc, \\\"breaking\\\" was also street slang for \\\"getting excited\\\" and \\\"acting energetically\\\"\\nDJs such as Grand Wizzard Theodore, Grandmaster Flash, and Jazzy Jay refined and developed the use of breakbeats, including cutting and scratching. The approach used by Herc was soon widely copied, and by the late 1970s, DJs were releasing 12-inch records where they would rap to the beat. Influential tunes included Fatback Band's \\\"King Tim III (Personality Jock),\\\" The Sugarhill Gang's \\\"Rapper's Delight,\\\" and Kurtis Blow's \\\"Christmas Rappin',\\\" all released in 1979. Herc and other DJs would connect their equipment to power lines and perform at venues such as public basketball courts and at 1520 Sedgwick Avenue, Bronx, New York, now officially a historic building. The equipment consisted of numerous speakers, turntables, and one or more microphones. By using this technique, DJs could create a variety of music, but according to Rap Attack by David Toop \\\"At its worst the technique could turn the night into one endless and inevitably boring song\\\". KC The Prince of Soul, a rapper-lyricist with Pete DJ Jones, is often credited with being the first rap lyricist to call himself an \\\"MC.\\\"Street gangs were prevalent in the poverty of the South Bronx, and much of the graffiti, rapping, and b-boying at these parties were all artistic variations on the competition and one-upmanship of street gangs. Sensing that gang members' often violent urges could be turned into creative ones, Afrika Bambaataa founded the Zulu Nation, a loose confederation of street-dance crews, graffiti artists, and rap musicians. By the late 1970s, the culture had gained media attention, with Billboard magazine printing an article titled \\\"B Beats Bombarding Bronx\\\", commenting on the local phenomenon and mentioning influential figures such as Kool Herc. The New York City blackout of 1977 saw widespread looting, arson, and other citywide disorders especially in the Bronx where a number of looters stole DJ equipment from electronics stores. As a result, the hip hop genre, barely known outside of the Bronx at the time, grew at an astounding rate from 1977 onward.\\n\\nDJ Kool Herc's house parties gained popularity and later moved to outdoor venues in order to accommodate more people. Hosted in parks, these outdoor parties became a means of expression and an outlet for teenagers, where \\\"instead of getting into trouble on the streets, teens now had a place to expend their pent-up energy.\\\" Tony Tone, a member of the Cold Crush Brothers, stated that \\\"hip hop saved a lot of lives\\\". For inner-city youth, participating in hip hop culture became a way of dealing with the hardships of life as minorities within America, and an outlet to deal with the risk of violence and the rise of gang culture. MC Kid Lucky mentions that \\\"people used to break-dance against each other instead of fighting\\\". Inspired by DJ Kool Herc, Afrika Bambaataa created a street organization called Universal Zulu Nation, centered around hip hop, as a means to draw teenagers out of gang life, drugs and violence.\\n\\nThe lyrical content of many early rap groups focused on social issues, most notably in the seminal track \\\"The Message\\\" (1982) by Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five, which discussed the realities of life in the housing projects. \\\"Young black Americans coming out of the civil rights movement have used hip hop culture in the 1980s and 1990s to show the limitations of the movement.\\\" Hip hop gave young African Americans a voice to let their issues be heard; \\\"Like rock-and-roll, hip hop is vigorously opposed by conservatives because it romanticizes violence, law-breaking, and gangs\\\". It also gave people a chance for financial gain by \\\"reducing the rest of the world to consumers of its social concerns.\\\"In late 1979, Debbie Harry of Blondie took Nile Rodgers of Chic to such an event, as the main backing track used was the break from Chic's \\\"Good Times\\\". The new style influenced Harry, and Blondie's later hit single from 1981 \\\"Rapture\\\" became the first major single containing hip hop elements by a white group or artist to hit number one on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100--the song itself is usually considered new wave and fuses heavy pop music elements, but there is an extended rap by Harry near the end.\\n\\n\\n=== 1980s ===\\nIn 1980, Kurtis Blow released his self-titled debut album featuring the single \\\"The Breaks\\\", which became the first certified gold rap song.In 1982, Afrika Bambaataa and the Soulsonic Force released the electro-funk track \\\"Planet Rock\\\". Instead of simply rapping over disco beats, Bambaataa and producer Arthur Baker created an electronic sound using the Roland TR-808 drum machine and sampling from Kraftwerk. \\\"Planet Rock\\\" is widely regarded as a turning point; fusing electro with hip hop, it was \\\"like a light being switched on,\\\" resulting in a new genre. The track also helped popularize the 808, which became a cornerstone of hip hop music; Wired and Slate both described the machine as hip hop's equivalent to the Fender Stratocaster, which had dramatically influenced the development of rock music. Other groundbreaking records released in 1982 include \\\"The Message\\\" by Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five, \\\"Nunk\\\" by Warp 9, \\\"Hip Hop, Be Bop (Don't Stop)\\\" by Man Parrish, \\\"Magic Wand\\\" by Whodini, and  \\\"Buffalo Gals\\\" by Malcolm McLaren. In 1983, Hashim created the influential electro funk tune \\\"Al-Naafiysh (The Soul)\\\", while Warp 9's \\\"Light Years Away\\\"(1983), \\\"a cornerstone of early 80s beat box afrofuturism\\\", introduced socially conscious themes from a Sci-Fi perspective, paying homage to music pioneer Sun Ra.\\n\\nEncompassing graffiti art, MCing/rapping, DJing and b-boying, hip hop became the dominant cultural movement of the minority-populated urban communities in the 1980s. The 1980s also saw many artists make social statements through hip hop. In 1982, Melle Mel and Duke Bootee recorded \\\"The Message\\\" (officially credited to Grandmaster Flash and The Furious Five), a song that foreshadowed the socially conscious statements of Run-DMC's \\\"It's like That\\\" and Public Enemy's \\\"Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos\\\". During the 1980s, hip hop also embraced the creation of rhythm by using the human body, via the vocal percussion technique of beatboxing. Pioneers such as Doug E. Fresh, Biz Markie and Buffy from the Fat Boys made beats, rhythm, and musical sounds using their mouth, lips, tongue, voice, and other body parts. \\\"Human Beatbox\\\" artists would also sing or imitate turntablism scratching or other instrument sounds.\\nThe appearance of music videos changed entertainment: they often glorified urban neighborhoods. The music video for \\\"Planet Rock\\\" showcased the subculture of hip hop musicians, graffiti artists, and b-boys/b-girls. Many hip hop-related films were released between 1982 and 1985, among them Wild Style, Beat Street, Krush Groove, Breakin, and the documentary Style Wars. These films expanded the appeal of hip hop beyond the boundaries of New York. By 1984, youth worldwide were embracing the hip hop culture. The hip hop artwork and \\\"slang\\\" of US urban communities quickly found its way to Europe, as the culture's global appeal took root. The four traditional dances of hip hop are rocking, b-boying/b-girling, locking and popping, all of which trace their origins to the late 1960s or early 1970s.Women artists have also been at the forefront of the hip hop movement since its inception in the Bronx. Nevertheless, as gangsta rap became the dominant force in hip hop music, there were many songs with misogynistic (anti-women) lyrics and many music videos depicted women in a sexualized fashion. The negation of female voice and perspective is an issue that has come to define mainstream hip hop music. The recording industry is less willing to back female artists than their male counterparts, and when it does back them, often it places emphasis on their sexuality over their musical substance and artistic abilities. Since the turn of the century (the beginning of the 2000s decade), female hip hop artists have struggled to get mainstream attention, with only a few, such as older artists like the female duo Salt N' Pepa to more contemporary ones like Lil' Kim and Nicki Minaj, reaching platinum status.\\n\\n\\n=== 1990s ===\\n\\nWith the commercial success of gangsta rap in the early 1990s, the emphasis in lyrics shifted to drugs, violence, and misogyny. Early proponents of gangsta rap included groups and artists such as Ice-T, who recorded what some consider to be the first gangster rap record, 6 N' the Mornin', and N.W.A whose second album Niggaz4Life became the first gangsta rap album to enter the charts at number one. Gangsta rap also played an important part in hip hop becoming a mainstream commodity. Considering albums such as N.W.A's Straight Outta Compton, Eazy-E's Eazy-Duz-It, and Ice Cube's Amerikkka's Most Wanted were selling in such high numbers meant that black teens were no longer hip hop's sole buying audience. As a result, gangsta rap became a platform for artists who chose to use their music to spread political and social messages to parts of the country that were previously unaware of the conditions of ghettos. While hip hop music now appeals to a broader demographic, media critics argue that socially and politically conscious hip hop has been largely disregarded by mainstream America.\\n\\n\\n=== Global innovations ===\\n\\nAccording to the U.S. Department of State, hip hop is \\\"now the center of a mega music and fashion industry around the world\\\" that crosses social barriers and cuts across racial lines. National Geographic recognizes hip hop as \\\"the world's favorite youth culture\\\" in which \\\"just about every country on the planet seems to have developed its own local rap scene.\\\" Through its international travels, hip hop is now considered a \\\"global musical epidemic\\\".\\nAccording to The Village Voice, hip hop is \\\"custom-made to combat the anomie that preys on adolescents wherever nobody knows their name.\\\"Hip hop sounds and styles differ from region to region, but there are also instances of fusion genres. Hip hop culture has grown from the avoided genre to a genre that is followed by millions of fans worldwide. This was made possible by the adaptation of music in different locations, and the influence on style of behavior and dress. Not all countries have embraced hip hop, where \\\"as can be expected in countries with strong local culture, the interloping wildstyle of hip hop is not always welcomed\\\". This is somewhat the case in Jamaica, the homeland of the culture's father, DJ Kool Herc. However, despite hip hop music produced on the island lacking widespread local and international recognition, artists such as Five Steez have defied the odds by impressing online hip hop taste-makers and even reggae critics.Hartwig Vens argues that hip hop can also be viewed as a global learning experience. Author Jeff Chang argues that \\\"the essence of hip hop is the cipher, born in the Bronx, where competition and community feed each other.\\\" He also adds, \\\"Thousands of organizers from Cape Town to Paris use hip hop in their communities to address environmental justice, policing and prisons, media justice, and education.\\\". While hip hop music has been criticized as a music that creates a divide between western music and music from the rest of the world, a musical \\\"cross pollination\\\" has taken place, which strengthens the power of hip hop to influence different communities. Hip hop's messages allow the under-privileged and the mistreated to be heard. These cultural translations cross borders. While the music may be from a foreign country, the message is something that many people can relate to- something not \\\"foreign\\\" at all.Even when hip hop is transplanted to other countries, it often retains its \\\"vital progressive agenda that challenges the status quo.\\\" In Gothenburg, Sweden, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) incorporate graffiti and dance to engage disaffected immigrant and working class youths. Hip hop has played a small but distinct role as the musical face of revolution in the Arab Spring, one example being an anonymous Libyan musician, Ibn Thabit, whose anti-government songs fueled the rebellion.\\n\\n\\n=== Commercialization ===\\n\\nIn the early- to-mid 1980s, there was no established hip hop music industry, as exists in the 2010s, with record labels, record producers, managers and Artists and Repertoire staff. Politicians and businesspeople maligned and ignored the hip hop movement. Most hip hop artists performed in their local communities and recorded in underground scenes. However, in the late 1980s, music industry executives realized that they could capitalize on the success of \\\"gangsta rap.\\\" They made a formula that created \\\"a titillating buffet of hypermasculinity and glorified violence.\\\" This type of rap was marketed to the new fanbase: white males. They ignored the depictions of a harsh reality to focus on the sex and violence involved.In an article for The Village Voice, Greg Tate argues that the commercialization of hip hop is a negative and pervasive phenomenon, writing that \\\"what we call hiphop is now inseparable from what we call the hip hop industry, in which the nouveau riche and the super-rich employers get richer\\\". Ironically, this commercialization coincides with a decline in rap sales and pressure from critics of the genre. Even other musicians, like Nas and KRS-ONE have claimed \\\"hip hop is dead\\\" in that it has changed so much over the years to cater to the consumer that it has lost the essence for which it was originally created.\\nHowever, in his book In Search Of Africa, Manthia Diawara states that hip hop is really a voice of people who are marginalized in modern society. He argues that the \\\"worldwide spread of hip hop as a market revolution\\\" is actually global \\\"expression of poor people's desire for the good life,\\\" and that this struggle aligns with \\\"the nationalist struggle for citizenship and belonging, but also reveals the need to go beyond such struggles and celebrate the redemption of the black individual through tradition.\\\" The problem may not be that female rappers do not have the same opportunities and recognition as their male counterparts; it may be that the music industry that is so defined by gender biases. Industry executives seem to bet on the idea that men won't want to listen to female rappers, so they are given fewer opportunities.As the hip hop genre has changed since the 1980s, the African-American cultural \\\"tradition\\\" that Diawara describes has little place in hip hop's mainstream artists music. The push toward materialism and market success by contemporary rappers such as Rick Ross, Lil Wayne and Jay Z has irked older hip hop fans and artists. They see the genre losing its community-based feel that focused more on black empowerment than wealth. The commercialization of the genre stripped it of its earlier political nature and the politics and marketing plans of major record labels have forced rappers to craft their music and images to appeal to white, affluent and suburban audiences.\\nAfter realizing her friends were making music but not getting television exposure other than what was seen on Video Music Box, Darlene Lewis (model/lyricist), along with Darryl Washington and Dean Carroll, brought hip hop music to the First Exposure cable show on Paragon cable, and then created the On Broadway television show. There, rappers had opportunities to be interviewed and have their music videos played. This pre-dated MTV or Video Soul on BET. The commercialization has made hip hop less edgy and authentic, but it also has enabled hip hop artists to become successful.As top rappers grow wealthier and start more outside business ventures, this can indicate a stronger sense of black aspiration. As rappers such as Jay-Z and Kanye West establish themselves as artists and entrepreneurs, more young black people have hopes of achieving their goals. The lens through which one views the genre's commercialization can make it seem positive or negative.White and Mexican Latino pop rappers such as Macklemore, Iggy Azalea, Machine Gun Kelly, Eminem, Miley Cyrus, G-Eazy, Pitbull, Lil Pump, and Post Malone have often been criticized for commercializing hip hop and cultural appropriation. Miley Cyrus and Katy Perry, although not rappers, have been accused of cultural appropriation and commercializing hip hop. Katy Perry, a white woman, was criticized for her hip hop song \\\"Dark Horse\\\". Taylor Swift was also accused of cultural appropriation.\\n\\n\\n== Culture ==\\nDJing and turntablism, MCing/rapping, breakdancing, graffiti art, and beatboxing are the creative outlets that collectively make up hip hop culture and its revolutionary aesthetic. Like the blues, these arts were developed by African American communities to enable people to make a statement, whether political or emotional and participate in community activities. These practices spread globally around the 1980s as fans could \\\"make it their own\\\" and express themselves in new and creative ways in music, dance and other arts.\\n\\n\\n=== DJing ===\\n\\nDJing and turntablism are the techniques of manipulating sounds and creating music and beats using two or more phonograph turntables (or other sound sources, such as tapes, CDs or digital audio files) and a DJ mixer that is plugged into a PA system. One of the first few hip hop DJs was Kool DJ Herc, who created hip hop in the 1970s through the isolation and extending of \\\"breaks\\\" (the parts of albums that focused solely on the percussive beat). In addition to developing Herc's techniques, DJs Grandmaster Flowers, Grandmaster Flash, Grand Wizzard Theodore, and Grandmaster Caz made further innovations with the introduction of \\\"scratching\\\", which has become one of the key sounds associated with hip hop music.\\nTraditionally, a DJ will use two turntables simultaneously and mix between the two. These are connected to a DJ mixer, an amplifier, speakers, and various electronic music equipment such as a microphone and effects units. The DJ mixes the two albums currently in rotation and/or does \\\"scratching\\\" by moving one of the record platters while manipulating the crossfader on the mixer. The result of mixing two records is a unique sound created by the seemingly combined sound of two separate songs into one song. Although there is considerable overlap between the two roles, a DJ is not the same as a record producer of a music track. The development of DJing was also influenced by new turntablism techniques, such as beatmatching, a process facilitated by the introduction of new turntable technologies such as the Technics SL-1200 MK 2, first sold in 1978, which had a precise variable pitch control and a direct drive motor. DJs were often avid record collectors, who would hunt through used record stores for obscure soul records and vintage funk recordings. DJs helped to introduce rare records and new artists to club audiences.\\n\\nIn the early years of hip hop, the DJs were the stars, as they created new music and beats with their record players. While DJing and turntablism continue to be used in hip hop music in the 2010s, the star role has increasingly been taken by MCs since the late 1970s, due to innovative, creative MCs such as Kurtis Blow and Melle Mel of Grandmaster Flash's crew, the Furious Five, who developed strong rapping skills. However, a number of DJs have gained stardom nonetheless in recent years. Famous DJs include Grandmaster Flash, Afrika Bambaataa, Mr. Magic, DJ Jazzy Jeff, DJ Scratch from EPMD, DJ Premier from Gang Starr, DJ Scott La Rock from Boogie Down Productions, DJ Pete Rock of Pete Rock & CL Smooth, DJ Muggs from Cypress Hill, Jam Master Jay from Run-DMC, Eric B., DJ Screw from the Screwed Up Click and the inventor of the Chopped & Screwed style of mixing music, Funkmaster Flex, Tony Touch, DJ Clue, Mix Master Mike, Touch-Chill-Out, DJ Red Alert, and DJ Q-Bert. The underground movement of turntablism has also emerged to focus on the skills of the DJ. In the 2010s, there are turntablism competitions, where turntablists demonstrate advanced beat juggling and scratching skills.\\n\\n\\n=== MCing ===\\n\\nRapping (also known as emceeing, MCing, spitting (bars), or just rhyming) refers to \\\"spoken or chanted rhyming lyrics with a strong rhythmic accompaniment\\\". Rapping typically features complex wordplay, rapid delivery, and a range of \\\"street slang\\\", some of which is unique to the hip hop subculture. While rapping is often done over beats, either done by a DJ, a beatboxer, it can also be done without accompaniment. It can be broken down into different components, such as \\\"content\\\", \\\"flow\\\" (rhythm and rhyme), and \\\"delivery\\\". Rapping is distinct from spoken word poetry in that it is performed in time to the beat of the music. The use of the word \\\"rap\\\" to describe quick and slangy speech or witty repartee long predates the musical form. MCing is a form of expression that is embedded within ancient African culture and oral tradition as throughout history verbal acrobatics or jousting involving rhymes were common within the Afro-American community.\\n\\n\\n=== Graffiti ===\\n\\nGraffiti is the most controversial of hip hop's elements, as a number of the most notable graffiti pioneers say that they do not consider graffiti to be an element of hip hop, including Lady Pink, Seen, Blade, Fargo, Cholly Rock, Fuzz One, and Coco 144. Lady Pink says, \\\"I don't think graffiti is hip hop. Frankly I grew up with disco music. There's a long background of graffiti as an entity unto itself,\\\" and Fargo says, \\\"There is no correlation between hip hop and graffiti, one has nothing to do with the other.\\\" Hip hop pioneer Grandmaster Flash has also questioned the connection between hip hop and graffiti, saying, \\\"You know what bugs me, they put hip hop with graffiti. How do they intertwine?\\\"In America in the late 1960s, graffiti was used as a form of expression by political activists. Gangs such as the Savage Skulls, La Familia, and Savage Nomads used graffiti to mark territory. JULIO 204 was a Puerto Rican graffiti writer, one of the first graffiti writers in New York City. He was a member of the \\\"Savage Skulls\\\" gang, and started writing his nickname in his neighborhood as early as 1968. In 1971 the New York Times published an article (\\\"'Taki 183' Spawns Pen Pals\\\") about another graffiti writer with similar form, TAKI 183. According to the article Julio had been writing for a couple of years when Taki began tagging his own name all around the city. Taki also states in the article that Julio \\\"was busted and stopped.\\\" Writers following in the wake of Taki and Tracy 168 would add their street number to their nickname, \\\"bomb\\\" (cover) a train with their work, and let the subway take it--and their fame, if it was impressive, or simply pervasive, enough--\\\"all city\\\". Julio 204 never rose to Taki's fame because Julio kept his tags localized to his own neighborhood.\\n\\nOne of the most common forms of graffiti is tagging, or the act of stylizing your unique name or logo. Tagging began in Philadelphia and New York City and has expanded worldwide.  Spray painting public property or the property of others without their consent can be considered vandalism, and the \\\"tagger\\\" may be subject to arrest and prosecution for the criminal act.  Whether legal or not, the hip hop culture considers tagging buildings, trains, bridges and other structures as visual art, and consider the tags as part of a complex symbol system with its own social codes and subculture rules. Such art is in some cases now subject to federal protection in the US, making its erasure illegal.Bubble lettering held sway initially among writers from the Bronx, though the elaborate Brooklyn style Tracy 168 dubbed \\\"wildstyle\\\" would come to define the art. The early trend-setters were joined in the 1970s by artists like Dondi, Futura 2000, Daze, Blade, Lee, Fab Five Freddy, Zephyr, Rammellzee, Crash, Kel, NOC 167 and Lady Pink.The relationship between graffiti and hip hop culture arises both from early graffiti artists engaging in other aspects of hip hop culture, Graffiti is understood as a visual expression of rap music, just as breaking is viewed as a physical expression. The 1983 film Wild Style is widely regarded as the first hip hop motion picture, which featured prominent figures within the New York graffiti scene during the said period. The book Subway Art and the documentary Style Wars were also among the first ways the mainstream public were introduced to hip hop graffiti. Graffiti remains part of hip hop, while crossing into the mainstream art world with exhibits in galleries throughout the world.\\n\\n\\n=== Breakdancing ===\\n\\nBreaking, also called B-boying/B-girling or breakdancing, is a dynamic, rhythmic style of dance which developed as one of the major elements of hip hop culture. Like many aspects of hip hop culture, breakdance borrows heavily from many cultures, including 1930s-era street dancing, Brazilian and Asian Martial arts, Russian folk dance, and the dance moves of James Brown, Michael Jackson, and California funk. Breaking took form in the South Bronx in the 1970s alongside the other elements of hip hop. Breakdancing is typically done with the accompaniment of hip hop music playing on a boom box or PA system.\\n\\nAccording to the 2002 documentary film The Freshest Kids: A History of the B-Boy, DJ Kool Herc describes the \\\"B\\\" in B-boy as short for breaking, which at the time was slang for \\\"going off\\\", also one of the original names for the dance. However, early on the dance was known as the \\\"boing\\\" (the sound a spring makes). Dancers at DJ Kool Herc's parties saved their best dance moves for the percussion break section of the song, getting in front of the audience to dance in a distinctive, frenetic style. The \\\"B\\\" in B-boy or B-girl also stands simply for break, as in break-boy or -girl. Before the 1990s, B-girls' presence was limited by their gender minority status, navigating sexual politics of a masculine-dominated scene, and a lack of representation or encouragement for women to participate in the form. The few B-girls who participated despite facing gender discrimination carved out a space for women as leaders within the breaking community, and the number of B-girls participating has increased. Breaking was documented in Style Wars, and was later given more focus in fictional films such as Wild Style and Beat Street. Early acts include the Rock Steady Crew and New York City Breakers.\\n\\n\\n=== Beatboxing ===\\n\\nBeatboxing is the technique of vocal percussion, in which a singer imitates drums and other percussion instruments with her or his voice. It is primarily concerned with the art of creating beats or rhythms using the human mouth. The term beatboxing is derived from the mimicry of the first generation of drum machines, then known as beatboxes. It was first popularized by Doug E. Fresh.  As it is a way of creating hip hop music, it can be categorized under the production element of hip hop, though it does sometimes include a type of rapping intersected with the human-created beat. It is generally considered to be part of the same \\\"Pillar\\\" of hip hop as DJing--in other words, providing a musical backdrop or foundation for MC's to rap over.\\nBeatboxers can create their beats just naturally, but many of the beatboxing effects are enhanced by using a microphone plugged into a PA system. This helps the beatboxer to make their beatboxing loud enough to be heard alongside a rapper, MC, turntablist, and other hip hop artists. Beatboxing was popular in the 1980s with prominent artists like the Darren \\\"Buffy, the Human Beat Box\\\" Robinson of the Fat Boys and Biz Markie displaying their skills within the media. It declined in popularity along with b-boying in the late 1980s, but has undergone a resurgence since the late 1990s, marked by the release of \\\"Make the Music 2000.\\\" by Rahzel of The Roots.\\n\\n\\n=== Beatmaking/producing ===\\n\\nAlthough it is not described as one of the four core elements that make up hip hop, music producing is another important element. In music, record producers play a similar role in sound recording that film directors play in making a movie. The record producer recruits and selects artists (rappers, MCs, DJs, beatboxers, and so on), plans the vision for the recording session, coaches the performers on their songs, chooses audio engineers, sets out a budget for hiring the artists and technical experts, and oversees the entire project. The exact roles of a producer depend on each individual, but some producers work with DJs and drum machine programmers to create beats, coach the DJs in the selection of sampled basslines, riffs and catch phrases, give advice to rappers, vocalists, MCs and other artists, give suggestions to performers on how to improve their flow and develop a unique personal style. Some producers work closely with the audio engineer to provide ideas on mixing, effects units (e.g., Autotuned vocal effects such as those popularized by T-pain), micing of artists, and so on. The producer may independently develop the \\\"concept\\\" or vision for a project or album, or develop the vision in collaboration with the artists and performers.\\n\\nIn hip hop, since the beginning of MCing, there have been producers who work in the studio, behind the scenes, to create the beats for MCs to rap over. Producers may find a beat they like on an old funk, soul or disco record, and then isolate the beat and turn it into a loop. Alternatively, producers may create a beat with a drum machine or by hiring a drumkit percussionist to play acoustic drums. The producer could even mix and layer different methods, such as combining a sampled disco drum break with a drum machine track and some live, newly recorded percussion parts or a live electric bass player. A beat created by a hip hop producer may include other parts besides a drum beat, such as a sampled bassline from a funk or disco song, dialogue from a spoken word record or movie, or rhythmic \\\"scratching\\\" and \\\"punches\\\" done by a turntablist or DJ.\\nAn early beatmaker was producer Kurtis Blow, who won producer of the year credits in 1983, 1984, and 1985. Known for the creation of sample and sample loops, Blow was considered the Quincy Jones of early hip hop, a reference to the prolific African American record producer, conductor, arranger, composer, musician and bandleader. One of the most influential beatmakers was J. Dilla, a producer from Detroit who chopped samples by specific beats and would combine them together to create his unique sound. Those who create these beats are known as either beatmakers or producers, however producers are known to have more input and direction on the overall the creation of a song or project, while a beatmaker just provides or creates the beat. As Dr. Dre has said before \\\"Once you finish the beat, you have to produce the record.\\\" The process of making beats includes sampling, \\\"chopping\\\", looping, sequencing beats, recording, mixing, and mastering.\\nMost beats in hip hop are sampled from a pre-existing record. This means that a producer will take a portion or a \\\"sample\\\" of a song and reuse it as an instrumental section, beat or portion of their song. Some examples of this are The Isley Brothers' \\\"Footsteps in the Dark Pts. 1 and 2\\\" being sampled to make Ice Cube's \\\"Today Was a Good Day\\\". Another example is Otis Redding's \\\"Try a Little Tenderness\\\" being sampled to create the song \\\"Otis\\\",  released in 2011, by Kanye West and Jay-Z.\\\"Chopping\\\" is dissecting the song that you are sampling so that you \\\"chop\\\" out the part or parts of the song, be that the bassline, rhythm guitar part, drum break, or other music, you want to use in the beat. Looping is known as melodic or percussive sequence that repeats itself over a period of time, so basically a producer will make an even-number of bars of a beat (e.g., four bars or eight bars) repeat itself or \\\"loop\\\" of a full song length. This loop provides an accompaniment for an MC to rap over.\\n\\nThe tools needed to make beats in the late 1970s were funk, soul, and other music genre records, record turntables, DJ mixers, audio consoles, and relatively inexpensive Portastudio-style multitrack recording devices. In the 1980s and 1990s, beatmakers and producers used the new electronic and digital instruments that were developed, such as samplers, sequencers, drum machines, and synthesizers. From the 1970s to the 2010s, various beatmakers and producers have used live instruments, such as drum kit or electric bass on some tracks. To record the finished beats or beat tracks, beatmakers and producers use a variety of sound recording equipment, typically multitrack recorders. Digital Audio Workstations, also known as DAWs, became more common in the 2010s for producers. Some of the most used DAWs are FL Studio, Ableton Live, and Pro Tools. DAWs have made it possible for more people to be able to make beats in their own home studio, without going to a recording studio. Beatmakers who own DAWs do not have to buy all the hardware that a recording studio needed in the 1980s (huge 72 channel audio consoles, multitrack recorders, racks of rackmount effects units), because 2010-era DAWs have everything they need to make\\nbeats on a good quality, fast laptop computer.Beats are such an integral part of rap music that many producers have been able to make instrumental mixtapes or albums. Even though these instrumentals have no rapping, listeners still enjoy the inventive ways the producer mixes different beats, samples and instrumental melodies. Examples of these are 9th Wonder's \\\"Tutenkhamen\\\" and J Dilla's \\\"Donuts\\\". Some hip hop records come in two versions: a beat with rapping over it, and an instrumental with just the beat. The instrumental in this case is provided so that DJs and turntablists can isolate breaks, beats and other music to create new songs.\\n\\n\\n== Social impact ==\\n\\n\\n=== Effects ===\\n\\nHip hop has made a considerable social impact since its inception in the 1970s. \\\"Hip hop has also become relevant to the field of education because of its implications for understanding language, learning, identity, and curriculum.\\\" Orlando Patterson, a sociology professor at Harvard University, helps describe the phenomenon of how hip hop has spread rapidly around the world. Patterson argues that mass communication is controlled by the wealthy, the government, and major businesses in Third World nations and countries around the world. He also credits mass communication with creating a global cultural hip hop scene. As a result, the youth are influenced by the American hip hop scene and start their own forms of hip hop. Patterson believes that revitalization of hip hop music will occur around the world as traditional values are mixed with American hip hop music, and ultimately a global exchange process will develop that brings youth around the world to listen to a common musical form of hip hop.\\nIt has also been argued that rap music formed as a \\\"cultural response to historic oppression and racism, a system for communication among black communities throughout the United States\\\". This is due to the fact that the culture reflected the social, economic and political realities of the disenfranchized youth. In the 2010s, hip hop lyrics are starting to reflect original socially conscious themes. Rappers are starting to question the government's power and its oppressive role in some societies. Rap music has been a tool for political, social, and cultural empowerment outside the US. Members of minority communities--such as Algerians in France, and Turks in Germany--use rap as a platform to protest racism, poverty, and social structures.\\n\\n\\n=== Language ===\\nThe development of hip hop linguistics is complex. Source material include the spirituals of slaves arriving in the new world, Jamaican dub music, the laments of jazz and blues singers, patterned cockney slang and radio deejays hyping their audience using rhymes. Hip hop has a distinctive associated slang. It is also known by alternate names, such as \\\"Black English\\\", or \\\"Ebonics\\\". Academics suggest its development stems from a rejection of the racial hierarchy of language, which held \\\"White English\\\" as the superior form of educated speech. Due to hip hop's commercial success in the late 1990s and early 2000s, many of these words have been assimilated into the cultural discourse of several different dialects across America and the world and even to non-hip hop fans. The word diss for example is particularly prolific. There are also a number of words which predate hip hop, but are often associated with the culture, with homie being a notable example. Sometimes, terms like what the dilly, yo are popularized by a single song (in this case, \\\"Put Your Hands Where My Eyes Could See\\\" by Busta Rhymes) and are only used briefly. One particular example is the rule-based slang of Snoop Dogg and E-40, who add -izzle or -izz to the end or middle of words.\\nHip hop lyricism has gained a measure of legitimacy in academic and literary circles. Studies of hip hop linguistics are now offered at institutions such as the University of Toronto, where poet and author George Eliot Clarke has taught the potential power of hip hop music to promote social change. Greg Thomas of the University of Miami offers courses at both the undergraduate and graduate level studying the feminist and assertive nature of Lil' Kim's lyrics. Some academics, including Ernest Morrell and Jeffrey Duncan-Andrade, compare hip hop to the satirical works of great \\\"Western canon\\\" poets of the modern era, who use imagery and create a mood to criticize society. As quoted in their work \\\"Promoting Academic Literacy with Urban Youth Through Engaging Hip Hop Culture\\\":\\n\\nHip Hop lyrics have also been known for containing swear words. In particular, the word \\\"bitch\\\" is seen in countless songs, from NWA's \\\"A Bitch Iz a bitch\\\" to Missy Elliot's \\\"She is a Bitch.\\\" It is often used in the negative connotation of a woman who is a shallow \\\"money grubber\\\". Some female artists have tried to reclaim the word and use it as a term of empowerment. Regardless, the hip hop community has recently taken an interest in discussing the use of the word \\\"bitch\\\" and whether it is necessary in rap. Not only the particular words, but also the choice of which language in which rap is widely debated topic in international hip hop. In Canada, the use of non-standard variants of French, such as Franglais, a mix of French and English, by groups such as Dead Obies) or Chiac (such as Radio Radio) has powerful symbolic implications for Canadian language politics and debates on Canadian identity. In the United States rappers choose to rap in English, Spanish, or Spanglish, depending on their own backgrounds and their intended audience.\\n\\n\\n=== Censorship ===\\n\\nHip hop music has been censored on radio and TV due to the explicit lyrics of certain genres. Many songs have been criticized for anti-establishment and sometimes violent messages. The use of profanity as well as graphic depictions of violence and sex in hip hop music videos and songs makes it hard to broadcast on television stations such as MTV, in music video form, and on radio. As a result, many hip hop recordings are broadcast in censored form, with offending language \\\"bleeped\\\" or blanked out of the soundtrack, or replaced with \\\"clean\\\" lyrics. The result - which sometimes renders the remaining lyrics unintelligible or contradictory to the original recording - has become almost as widely identified with the genre as any other aspect of the music, and has been parodied in films such as Austin Powers in Goldmember, in which Mike Myers' character Dr. Evil - performing in a parody of a hip hop music video (\\\"Hard Knock Life\\\" by Jay-Z) - performs an entire verse that is blanked out. In 1995, Roger Ebert wrote:\\nIn 1990, Luther Campbell and his group 2 Live Crew filed a lawsuit against Broward County Sheriff Nick Navarro, because Navarro wanted to prosecute stores that sold the group's album As Nasty As They Wanna Be because of its obscene and vulgar lyrics. In June 1990, a U.S. district court judge labeled the album obscene and illegal to sell. However, in 1992, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit overturned the obscenity ruling from Judge Gonzalez, and the Supreme Court of the United States refused to hear Broward County's appeal. Professor Louis Gates testified on behalf of The 2 Live Crew, arguing that the material that the county alleged was profane actually had important roots in African-American vernacular, games, and literary traditions and should be protected.\\n\\nGangsta rap is a subgenre of hip hop that reflects the violent culture of inner-city American black youths. The genre was pioneered in the mid-1980s by rappers such as Schoolly D and Ice-T, and was popularized in the later part of the 1980s by groups such as N.W.A. Ice-T released \\\"6 in the Mornin'\\\", which is often regarded as the first gangsta rap song, in 1986. After the national attention that Ice-T and N.W.A created in the late 1980s and early 1990s, gangsta rap became the most commercially lucrative subgenre of hip hop.\\nN.W.A is the group most frequently associated with the founding of gangsta rap. Their lyrics were more violent, openly confrontational, and shocking than those of established rap acts, featuring incessant profanity and, controversially, use of the word \\\"nigga\\\". These lyrics were placed over rough, rock guitar-driven beats, contributing to the music's hard-edged feel. The first blockbuster gangsta rap album was N.W.A's Straight Outta Compton, released in 1988. Straight Outta Compton would establish West Coast hip hop as a vital genre, and establish Los Angeles as a legitimate rival to hip hop's long-time capital, New York City. Straight Outta Compton sparked the first major controversy regarding hip hop lyrics when their song \\\"Fuck tha Police\\\" earned a letter from FBI Assistant Director Milt Ahlerich, strongly expressing law enforcement's resentment of the song.Controversy surrounded Ice-T's song \\\"Cop Killer\\\" from the album Body Count. The song was intended to speak from the viewpoint of a criminal getting revenge on racist, brutal cops. Ice-T's rock song infuriated government officials, the National Rifle Association and various police advocacy groups. Consequently, Time Warner Music refused to release Ice-T's upcoming album Home Invasion because of the controversy surrounding \\\"Cop Killer\\\". Ice-T suggested that the furor over the song was an overreaction, telling journalist Chuck Philips \\\"...they've done movies about nurse killers and teacher killers and student killers. [Actor] Arnold Schwarzenegger blew away dozens of cops as the Terminator. But I don't hear anybody complaining about that.\\\" Ice-T suggested to Philips that the misunderstanding of \\\"Cop Killer\\\" and the attempts to censor it had racial overtones: \\\"The Supreme Court says it's OK for a white man to burn a cross in public. But nobody wants a black man to write a record about a cop killer.\\\"The White House administrations of both George Bush senior and Bill Clinton criticized the genre. \\\"The reason why rap is under attack is because it exposes all the contradictions of American culture ...What started out as an underground art form has become a vehicle to expose a lot of critical issues that are not usually discussed in American politics. The problem here is that the White House and wanna-bes like Bill Clinton represent a political system that never intends to deal with inner city urban chaos,\\\" Sister Souljah told The Times. Until its discontinuation on July 8, 2006, BET ran a late-night segment titled BET: Uncut to air nearly-uncensored videos. The show was exemplified by music videos such as \\\"Tip Drill\\\" by Nelly, which was criticized for what many viewed as an exploitative depiction of women, particularly images of a man swiping a credit card between a stripper's buttocks.\\nPublic Enemy's \\\"Gotta Give the Peeps What They Need\\\" was censored on MTV, removing the words \\\"free Mumia\\\". After the attack on the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001, Oakland, California group The Coup was under fire for the cover art on their album Party Music, which featured the group's two members holding a guitar tuner and two sticks as the Twin Towers exploded behind them despite the fact that it was created months before the actual event. The group, having politically radical and Marxist lyrical content, said the cover meant to symbolize the destruction of capitalism. Their record label pulled the album until a new cover could be designed.\\n\\n\\n=== Product placement and endorsements ===\\n\\nCritics such as Businessweek's David Kiley argue that the discussion of products within hip hop culture may actually be the result of undisclosed product placement deals. Such critics allege that shilling or product placement takes place in commercial rap music, and that lyrical references to products are actually paid endorsements. In 2005, a proposed plan by McDonald's to pay rappers to advertise McDonald's products in their music was leaked to the press. After Russell Simmons made a deal with Courvoisier to promote the brand among hip hop fans, Busta Rhymes recorded the song \\\"Pass the Courvoisier\\\". Simmons insists that no money changed hands in the deal.\\n\\nThe symbiotic relationship has also stretched to include car manufacturers, clothing designers and sneaker companies, and many other companies have used the hip hop community to make their name or to give them credibility. One such beneficiary was Jacob the Jeweler, a diamond merchant from New York. Jacob Arabo's clientele included Sean Combs, Lil' Kim and Nas. He created jewelry pieces from precious metals that were heavily loaded with diamond and gemstones. As his name was mentioned in the song lyrics of his hip hop customers, his profile quickly rose. Arabo expanded his brand to include gem-encrusted watches that retail for hundreds of thousands of dollars, gaining so much attention that Cartier filed a trademark-infringement lawsuit against him for putting diamonds on the faces of their watches and reselling them without permission. Arabo's profile increased steadily until his June 2006 arrest by the FBI on money laundering charges.\\n\\nWhile some brands welcome the support of the hip hop community, one brand that did not was Cristal champagne maker Louis Roederer. A 2006 article from The Economist magazine featured remarks from managing director Frederic Rouzaud about whether the brand's identification with rap stars could affect their company negatively. His answer was dismissive: \\\"That's a good question, but what can we do? We can't forbid people from buying it. I'm sure Dom Perignon or Krug [champagne] would be delighted to have their business.\\\" In retaliation, many hip hop icons such as Jay-Z and Sean Combs, who previously included references to \\\"Cris\\\", ceased all mentions and purchases of the champagne. 50 Cent's deal with Vitamin Water, Dr. Dre's promotion of his Beats by Dr. Dre headphone line and Dr. Pepper, and Drake's commercial with Sprite are successful deals. Although product placement deals were not popular in the 1980s, MC Hammer was an early innovator in this type of strategy. With merchandise such as dolls, commercials for soft drinks and numerous television show appearances, Hammer began the trend of rap artists being accepted as mainstream pitchpeople for brands.\\n\\n\\n=== Media ===\\nHip hop culture has had extensive coverage in the media, especially in relation to television; there have been a number of television shows devoted to or about hip hop, including in Europe (\\\"H.I.P. H.O.P.\\\" in 1984). For many years, BET was the only television channel likely to play hip hop, but in recent years the channels VH1 and MTV have added a significant amount of hip hop to their play list. Run DMC became the first African American group to appear on MTV. With the emergence of the Internet, a number of online sites began to offer hip hop related video content.\\n\\n\\n=== Magazines ===\\nHip hop magazines describe hip hop's culture, including information about rappers and MCs, new hip hop music, concerts, events, fashion and history. The first hip hop publication, The Hip Hop Hit List was published in the 1980s. It contained the first rap music record chart. It was put out by two brothers from Newark, New Jersey, Vincent and Charles Carroll (who was also in a hip hop group known as The Nastee Boyz). They knew the art form very well and noticed the need for a hip hop magazine. DJs and rappers did not have a way to learn about rap music styles and labels. The periodical began as the first Rap record chart and tip sheet for DJs and was distributed through national record pools and record stores throughout the New York City Tri-State area. One of the founding publishers, Charles Carroll noted, \\\"Back then, all DJs came into New York City to buy their records but most of them did not know what was hot enough to spend money on, so we charted it.\\\" Jae Burnett became Vincent Carroll's partner and played an instrumental role in its later development.\\n\\nNew York tourists from abroad took the publication back home with them to other countries to share it, creating worldwide interest in the culture and new art form. It had a printed distribution of 50,000, a circulation rate of 200,000 with well over 25,000 subscribers. The \\\"Hip Hop Hit List\\\" was also the first to define hip hop as a culture introducing the many aspects of the art form such as fashion, music, dance, the arts and most importantly the language. For instance, on the cover the headliner included the tag \\\"All Literature was Produced to Meet Street Comprehension!\\\" which proved their loyalty not only to the culture but also to the streets. Most interviews were written verbatim which included their innovative broken English style of writing. Some of the early charts were written in the graffiti format tag style but was made legible enough for the masses.The Carroll Brothers were also consultants to the many record companies who had no idea how to market hip hop music. Vincent Carroll, the magazine's creator-publisher, went on to become a huge source for marketing and promoting the culture of hip hop, starting Blow-Up Media, the first hip hop marketing firm with offices in NYC's Tribeca district. At the age of 21, Vincent employed a staff of 15 and assisted in launching some of the culture's biggest and brightest stars (the Fugees, Nelly, the Outzidaz, feat. Eminem and many more). Later other publications spawned up including: Hip Hop Connection, XXL, Scratch, The Source and Vibe. Many individual cities have also produced their own local hip hop newsletters, while hip hop magazines with national distribution are found in a few other countries. The 21st century also ushered in the rise of online media, and hip hop fan sites now offer comprehensive hip hop coverage on a daily basis.\\n\\n\\n=== Fashion ===\\n\\nClothing, hair and other styles have been a big part of hip hop's social and cultural impact since the 1970s. Although the styles have changed over the decades, distinctive urban apparel and looks have been an important way for rappers, breakdancers and other hip hop community members to express themselves. As the hip hop music genre's popularity increased, so did the effect of its fashion. While there were early items synonymous with hip hop that crossed over into the mainstream culture, like Run-DMC's affinity for Adidas or the Wu-Tang Clan's championing of Clarks' Wallabees, it wasn't until its commercial peak that hip hop fashion became influential. Starting in the mid- to late 1990s, hip hop culture embraced some major designers and established a new connection with classic fashion. Brands such as Ralph Lauren, Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger all tapped into hip hop culture and gave very little in return. Moving into the new millennium, hip hop fashion consisted of baggy shirts, jeans, and jerseys. As names like Pharrell and Jay-Z started their own clothing lines and still others like Kanye West linked up with designers like Louis Vuitton, the clothes got tighter, more classically fashionable, and expensive.\\nAs hip hop has a seen a shift in the means by which its artists express their masculinity, from violence and intimidation to wealth-flaunting and entrepreneurship, it has also seen the emergence of rapper branding. The modern-day hip hop artist is no longer limited to music serving as their sole occupation or source of income. By the early 1990s, major apparel companies \\\"[had] realized the economic potential of tapping into hip hop culture...Tommy Hilfiger was one of the first major fashion designer[s] who actively courted rappers as a way of promoting his street wear\\\". By joining forces, the artist and the corporation are able to jointly benefit from each other's resources. Hip Hop artists are trend-setters and taste-makers. Their fans range from minority groups who can relate to their professed struggles to majority groups who cannot truly relate but like to \\\"consume the fantasy of living a more masculine life\\\". The rappers provide the \\\"cool, hip\\\" factor while the corporations deliver the product, advertising, and financial assets. Tommy Hilfiger, one of the first mainstream designers to actively court rappers as a way of promoting his street wear, serves a prototypical example of the hip hip/fashion collaborations:\\n\\nArtists now use brands as a means of supplemental income to their music or are creating and expanding their own brands that become their primary source of income. As Harry Elam explains, there has been a movement \\\"from the incorporation and redefinition of existing trends to actually designing and marketing products as hip hop fashion\\\".Drake, A$AP Rocky and Playboi Carti are famous rappers who got into modeling.\\n\\n\\n=== Diversification ===\\n\\nHip hop music has spawned dozens of subgenres which incorporate hip hop music production approaches, such as sampling, creating beats, or rapping. The diversification process stems from the appropriation of hip hop culture by other ethnic groups. There are many varying social influences that affect hip hop's message in different nations. It is frequently used as a musical response to perceived political and/or social injustices. In South Africa the largest form of hip hop is called Kwaito, which has had a growth similar to American hip hop. Kwaito is a direct reflection of a post apartheid South Africa and is a voice for the voiceless; a term that U.S. hip hop is often referred to. Kwaito is even perceived as a lifestyle, encompassing many aspects of life, including language and fashion.Kwaito is a political and party-driven genre, as performers use the music to express their political views, and also to express their desire to have a good time. Kwaito is a music that came from a once hated and oppressed people, but it is now sweeping the nation. The main consumers of Kwaito are adolescents and half of the South African population is under 21. Some of the large Kwaito artists have sold more than 100,000 albums, and in an industry where 25,000 albums sold is considered a gold record, those are impressive numbers. Kwaito allows the participation and creative engagement of otherwise socially excluded peoples in the generation of popular media. South African hip hop is more diverse lately and there are hip hop acts in South Africa that have made an impact and continue making impact worldwide. These include Tumi, Ben Sharpa, HipHop Pantsula, Tuks Senganga.\\n\\nIn Jamaica, the sounds of hip hop are derived from American and Jamaican influences. Jamaican hip hop is defined both through dancehall and reggae music. Jamaican Kool Herc brought the sound systems, technology, and techniques of reggae music to New York during the 1970s. Jamaican hip hop artists often rap in both Brooklyn and Jamaican accents. Jamaican hip hop subject matter is often influenced by outside and internal forces. Outside forces such as the bling-bling era of today's modern hip hop and internal influences coming from the use of anti-colonialism and marijuana or \\\"ganja\\\" references which Rastafarians believe bring them closer to God.Author Wayne Marshall argues that \\\"Hip hop, as with any number of African-American cultural forms before it, offers a range of compelling and contradictory significations to Jamaican artist and audiences. From \\\"modern blackness\\\" to \\\"foreign mind\\\", transnational cosmopolitanism to militant pan-Africanism, radical remixology to outright mimicry, hip hop in Jamaica embodies the myriad ways that Jamaicans embrace, reject, and incorporate foreign yet familiar forms.\\\"\\n\\nIn the developing world, hip hop has made a considerable impact in the social context. Despite the lack of resources, hip hop has made considerable inroads. Due to limited funds, hip hop artists are forced to use very basic tools, and even graffiti, an important aspect of the hip hop culture, is constrained due to its unavailability to the average person. Hip hop has begun making inroads with more than black artists. There are number of other minority artists who are taking center stage as many first generation minority children come of age. One example is rapper Awkwafina, an Asian-American, who raps about being Asian as well as being female. She, like many others, use rap to express her experiences as a minority not necessarily to \\\"unite\\\" minorities together but to tell her story.\\nMany hip hop artists that make it out of the developing world come to places like the United States in hopes of improving their situations. Maya Arulpragasm (AKA M.I.A.) is a Sri Lanka-born Tamil hip hop artist in this situation. She claims, \\\"I'm just trying to build some sort of bridge, I'm trying to create a third place, somewhere in between the developed world and the developing world.\\\". Another music artist using hip hop to provide a positive message to young Africans is Emmanuel Jal, who is a former child soldier from South Sudan. Jal is one of the few South Sudanese music artists to have broken through on an international level with his unique form of hip hop and a positive message in his lyrics. Jal has attracted the attention of mainstream media and academics with his story and use of hip hop as a healing medium for war-afflicted people in Africa and has also been sought out for the international lecture circuit with major talks at popular talkfests like TED.Many K-Pop artists in South Korea have been influenced by hip hop. Many South Koreans perform hip hop music. In Seoul, South Korea, Koreans b-boy.Reggaeton is influenced by hip hop and is very popular in Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic. Bad Bunny and Ozuna are very popular Latin trap hip hop artists in Latin America.\\nCanadian artists Drake and Tory Lanez were influenced by American hip hop but made Canadian hip hop mainstream in the United States and Canada. In India, Hip-Hop is becoming popular.\\n\\n\\n=== Education ===\\nScholars argue that hip hop can have an empowering effect on youth. While there is misogyny, violence, and drug use in rap music videos and lyrics, hip hop also displays many positive themes of self-reliance, resilience, and self-esteem. These messages can be inspiring for a youth living in poverty. A lot of rap songs contain references to strengthening the African American community promoting social causes. Social workers have used hip hop to build a relationship with at-risk youth and develop a deeper connection with the child. Hip hop has the potential to be taught as a way of helping people see the world more critically, be it through forms of writing, creating music, or social activism. The lyrics of hip hop have been used to learn about literary devices such as metaphor, imagery, irony, tone, theme, motif, plot, and point of view.Organizations and facilities are providing spaces and programs for communities to explore making and learning about hip hop. An example is the IMP Labs in Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada. Many dance studios and colleges now offer lessons in hip hop alongside tap and ballet, as well as KRS-ONE teaching hip hop lectures at Harvard University.\\nHip hop producer 9th Wonder and former rapper-actor Christopher \\\"Play\\\" Martin from hip hop group Kid-n-Play have taught hip hop history classes at North Carolina Central University and 9th Wonder has also taught a \\\"Hip Hop Sampling Soul\\\" class at Duke University. In 2007, the Cornell University Library established a Hip Hop Collection to collect and make accessible the historical artifacts of hip hop culture and to ensure their preservation for future generations.\\n\\n\\n== Values and philosophy ==\\n\\n\\n=== Essentialism ===\\nSince the age of slavery, music has long been the language of African American identity. Because reading and writing were forbidden under the auspices of slavery, music became the only accessible form of communication. Hundreds of years later, in inner-city neighborhoods plagued by high illiteracy and dropout rates, music remains the most dependable medium of expression. Hip Hop is thus to the Hood as Negro Spirituals are to the Plantation: the emergent music articulates the terrors of one's environment better than written, or spoken word, thereby forging an \\\"unquestioned association of oppression with creativity [that] is endemic\\\" to African American culture\\\". In hip hop culture, it is thus considered essential to \\\"keep it real\\\" or to be authentic to the lived experiences of people from disadvantaged neighborhoods (\\\"the Ghetto\\\"). Despite the fact that hip hop artists typically use imagined scenarios and fictionalized stories in their raps, the culture demands that they act as if all their lyrics are true or potentially true. Because of this, lyrics of rap songs have often been treated as \\\"confessions\\\" to a number of violent crimes in the United States. It is also considered to be the duty of rappers and other hip hop artists (DJs, dancers) to \\\"represent\\\" their city and neighborhood. This demands being proud of being from disadvantaged cities neighborhoods that have traditionally been a source of shame, and glorifying them in lyrics and graffiti. This has potentially been one of the ways that hip hop has become regarded as a \\\"local\\\" rather than \\\"foreign\\\" genre of music in so many countries around the world in just a few decades. Nevertheless, sampling and borrowing from a number of genres and places is also a part of the hip hop milieu, and an album like the surprise hit Kala by Anglo-Tamil rapper M.I.A. was recorded in locations all across the world and features sounds from a different country on every track.According to scholar Joseph Schloss, the essentialist perspective of Hip Hop conspicuously obfuscates the role that individual style and pleasure plays in the development of the genre. Schloss notes that Hip Hop is forever fossilized as an inevitable cultural emergent, as if \\\"none of hip-hop's innovators had been born, a different group of poor black youth from the Bronx would have developed hip-hop in exactly the same way\\\". However, while the pervasive oppressive conditions of the Bronx were likely to produce another group of disadvantaged youth, he questions whether they would be equally interested, nonetheless willing to put in as much time and energy into making music as Grandmaster Flash, DJ Kool Herc, and Afrika Bambaataa. He thus concludes that Hip Hop was a result of choice, not fate, and that when individual contributions and artistic preferences are ignored, the genre's origin becomes overly attributed to collective cultural oppression.\\n\\n\\n=== Authenticity ===\\n\\nHip hop music artists and advocates have stated that hip hop has been an authentic (true and \\\"real\\\") African-American artistic and cultural form since its emergence in inner-city Bronx neighborhoods in the 1970s. Some music critics, scholars and political commentators have denied hip hop's authenticity. Advocates who claim hip hop is an authentic music genre state that it is an ongoing response to the violence and discrimination experienced by black people in the United States, from the slavery that existed into the 19th century, to the lynchings of the 20th century and the ongoing racial discrimination faced by blacks.Paul Gilroy and Alexander Weheliye state that unlike disco, jazz, R&B, house music, and other genres that were developed in the African-American community and which were quickly adopted and then increasingly controlled by white music industry executives, hip hop has remained largely controlled by African American artists, producers and executives. In his book, Phonographies, Weheliye describes the political and cultural affiliations that hip hop music enables. In contrast, Greg Tate states that the market-driven, commodity form of commercial hip hop has uprooted the genre from the celebration of African-American culture and the messages of protest that predominated in its early forms. Tate states that the commodification and commercialization of hip hop culture undermines the dynamism of the genre for African-American communities.\\nThese two dissenting understandings of hip hop's scope and influence frame debates that revolve around hip hop's possession of or lack of authenticity. Anticipating the market arguments of Tate and others, both Gilroy and Weheliye assert that hip hop has always had a different function than Western popular music as a whole, a function that exceeds the constraints of market capitalism. Weheliye notes, \\\"Popular music, generally in the form of recordings, has and still continues to function as one of the main channels of communication between the different geographical and cultural points in the African diaspora, allowing artists to articulate and perform their diasporic citizenship to international audiences and establish conversations with other diasporic communities.\\\" For Paul Gilroy, hip hop proves an outlet of articulation and a sonic space in which African Americans can exert control and influence that they often lack in other sociopolitical and economic domains.In \\\"Phonographies\\\", Weheyliye explains how new sound technologies used in hip hop encourage \\\"diasporic citizenship\\\" and African-American cultural and political activities. Gilroy states that the \\\"power of [hip hop] music [lies] in developing black struggles by communicating information, organizing consciousness, and testing out or deploying...individual or collective\\\" forms of African-American cultural and political actions. In the third chapter of The Black Atlantic, \\\"Jewels Brought from Bondage: Black Music and the Politics of Authenticity\\\", Gilroy asserts that these elements influence the production of and the interpretation of black cultural activities. What Gilroy calls the \\\"Black Atlantic\\\" music's rituals and traditions are a more expansive way of thinking about African-American \\\"blackness\\\", a way that moves beyond contemporary debates around essentialist and anti-essentialist arguments. As such, Gilroy states that music has been and remains a central staging ground for debates over the work, responsibility, and future role of black cultural and artistic production.\\n\\n\\n== Traditional vs. progressive views ==\\nEver since the over-commercialization of hip hop occurred between the late 1980s and the mid 1990s (at peak), traditional hip hop supporters have been in a feud with more progressive hip hop fans, claiming that they are uneducated towards what they are building. The traditionalists also claim that progressives are not only building music that steps further and further away from Hip Hop, but causes ignorance and misconceptions between fans of more progressive Hip Hop and fans of traditional Hip Hop culture. These views have been narrowed heavily over the past couple of years and have experienced change of views from the traditional side, as well as acceptance towards evolution of hip hop.\\nHowever, all of these beliefs seem to still be viewed under very specific sets of morals and ethics. Such as that one does not take themselves away, or deny the true past of hip hop (doing such would result in ignorance of the history of hip hop, and a completely disconnected community of fans who become uncertain as to what truly should be considered hip hop). Hip hop is also known to be the music of the oppressed (African Americans, Puerto Ricans and women) and activist based. Fans of more progressed Hip Hop have received both acclaim due to innovation and futuristic views, as well as strong criticism due to lack of proper education and what is felt as a completely changed form of values, rather than evolved.\\nLike most grassroots cultures, hip hop initially rejected the views and support of the mainstream industry, however eventually learned to be content due to the understanding of what opportunity and voice could be given. The Father of Hip Hop, DJ Kool Herc recently criticized the cancelled Netflix series The Get Down due to its lack of viewer response, by calling it 'The Let Down' and that legendary hip hop DJ Grandmaster Flash is Grandmaster Trash. Herc criticized the whole production for their misrepresentations of history and culture.\\nHowever, he did state that he does support many stars in rap today such as Lil Wayne and Drake. Herc, and many other old school hip hop legends such as Afrika Bambaataa and Grandmaster Caz originally held views against mainstream rap. However, recent interviews have shown to prove that even they have changed their ways to a certain extent. However, rappers like KRS-One still feel a strong disapproval of the rap industry, especially through mainstream media.In b-boying, most supporters have begun to slowly involve more industry sponsorship through events on the World BBoy Series and through the UDEF powered by Silverback Open. Other b-boys have begun to accept using the term breakdance, but only if the term b-boying is too difficult to communicate to the general public. Regardless of such, b-boys and b-girls still exist to showing lack of support to jams and events that they feel represent the culture as a sport, form of entertainment and as well through capitalism. Battle Rap as an industry has also been strongly supported by old-school/ golden-era legends such as Herc, Kid Capri and KRS-One.\\n\\n\\n== Reception ==\\n\\n\\n=== Commercialization and stereotyping ===\\nIn 2012, hip hop and rap pioneer Chuck D, from the group Public Enemy criticized young hip hop artists from the 2010s, stating that they have taken a music genre with extensive roots in underground music and turned it into commercialized pop music. In particular, seminal figures in the early underground, politically-motivated music, such as Ice T, have criticized current hip hop artists for being more concerned with image than substance. Critics have stated that 2010s hip hop artists are contributing to cultural stereotyping of African-American culture and are poseur gangsters. Critics have also stated that hip hop music promotes drug use and violence.Hip hop has been criticized by rock-centric critics who state that hip hop is not a true art form and who state that rock and roll music is more authentic. These critics are advocating a viewpoint called \\\"rockism\\\" which favors music written and performed by the individual artist (as seen in some famous singer-songwriter-led rock bands) and is against 2000s (decade)-era hip hop, which these critics argue give too large a role to record producers and digital sound recording. Hip hop is seen as being too violent and explicit, in comparison with rock. Some contend that the criticisms have racial overtones, as these critics deny that hip hop is an art form and praising rock genres that prominently feature white males.\\n\\n\\n=== Marginalization of women ===\\n\\nThe hip hop music genre and its subculture has been criticized for its gender bias and its negative impacts on women in African-American culture. Gangsta rap artists such as Eazy-E, Dr. aidz and Snoop Dogg have song lyrics that portray women as sex toys, and as people who are inferior to and dependent on men (though Eazy-E is deceased, Dr. Dre makes music less frequently sine about the '90s and has apologized for his views which carried over into actuality, and Snoop Dogg has become extremely diversified and changed his image in a positive way.) Between 1987 and 1993, over 400 hip hop songs had lyrics that described violence toward women including rape, assault, and murder. These anti-women hip hop lyrics have led some male listeners to make physical threats toward women and they have created negative stereotypes of young urban African-American women. Hip hop music promotes masculine hegemony and it depicts women as individuals who must rely on men. The portrayal of women in hip hop lyrics and videos tends to be violent, degrading, and highly sexualized. There is a high frequency of songs with lyrics that are demeaning, or depict sexual violence or sexual assault towards women. Videos often portray idealized female bodies and depict women as being the object of male pleasure.Very few female artists have been recognized in hip hop, and the most popular, successful and influential artists, record producers and music executives are males. Women who are in rap groups, such as Lauryn Hill of the Fugees, tend to have less advantages and opportunities than male artists.\\nFemale artists have received little to no recognition in hip hop. Only one female artist has won Best Rap album of the year at the Grammy Awards since the category was added in 1995. In addition, African American female hip hop artists have been recognized even less in the industry.\\n\\n\\n=== Marginalization of Latinas ===\\n\\nLatinas especially Cuban, Dominican and Puerto Rican women are degraded and fetishized in hip hop.\\nWhite women and Asian women are also fetishized in hip hop but not as much as Latinas, who are referred to as \\\"Spanish\\\". Latinas especially Puerto Rican models and Dominican models are often portrayed as a object of sexual desire in hip hop videos.\\n\\n\\n=== Homophobia and transphobia ===\\n\\nAs well, the hip hop music community has been criticized for its homophobia and transphobia. Hip hop song lyrics contain offensive, homophobic slurs (most popularly, the pejorative term \\\"faggot\\\") and sometimes violent threats towards queer people, such as rapper DMX's \\\"Where the Hood At,\\\" rapper Eazy-E's \\\"Nobody Move,\\\" rap group Brand Nubian's \\\"Punks Jump Up to Get Beat Down\\\". Many rappers and hip hop artists have advocated homophobia and/or transphobia. These artists include Ja Rule, who in an interview claimed,\\\"We need to go step to MTV and Viacom, and let's talk about all these fucking shows that they have on MTV that is promoting homosexuality, that my kids can't watch this shit,\\\" and rap artist Erick Sermon, who has said publicly,\\\"[Hip hop] will never accept transgender rappers.\\\" Until the 2010s, hip hop music has excluded the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community. This has perpetuated a culture in hip hop that is prejudiced towards queer and trans people, making it a tough culture for queer artists to participate in. Despite this prejudice, some queer/genderqueer rappers and hip hop artists have become successful and popular in the 2010s. One of the more notable members of the LGBT community in hip hop is Frank Ocean, who came out in 2012 and has released critically acclaimed albums and won two Grammy Awards. Other successful queer hip hop/rap artists include female bisexual rapper Azealia Banks, pansexual androgynous rapper and singer Angel Haze, lesbian rapper Siya, and genderqueer rapper Mykki Blanco.\\n\\n\\n== Legacy ==\\nHaving its roots in reggae, disco, funk and soul music, hip hop has since expanded worldwide. Its expansion includes events like Afrika Bambaataa's 1982 releasing of Planet Rock, which tried to establish a more global harmony. In the 1980s, the British Slick Rick became the first international hit hip hop artist not native to America. From the 1980s onward, television made hip hop global. From Yo! MTV Raps to Public Enemy's world tour, hip hop spread to Latin America and became a mainstream culture. Hip hop has been cut, mixed and adapted as it the music spreads to new areas.\\n\\n \\nEarly hip hop may have reduced inner-city gang violence by replacing physical violence with hip hop battles of breakdancing, turntablism, rapping and artwork. However, with the emergence of commercial and crime-related gangsta rap during the early 1990s, violence, drugs, weapons, and misogyny, were key themes. Socially and politically conscious hip hop has long been disregarded by mainstream America in favor of its media-baiting sibling, gangsta rap. Alternative hip hop artists attempt to reflect the original elements of the culture. Artists/groups such as Lupe Fiasco, Immortal Technique, Lowkey, Brother Ali, Public Enemy, The Roots, Shing02, Jay Electronica, Nas, Common, Talib Kweli, Mos Def, Dilated Peoples, Dead Prez, Bizzy Brown, Blackalicious, Jurassic 5, Jeru the Damaja, Kendrick Lamar, Gangstarr, KRS-One, Living Legends emphasize messages of verbal skill, internal/external conflicts, life lessons, unity, social issues, or activism.\\nBlack female artists such as Queen Latifah, Missy Elliott, and MC Lyte have made great strides since the hip hop industry first began. By producing music and an image that did not cater to the hyper-sexualized stereotypes of black women in hip hop, these women pioneered a revitalized and empowering image of black women in hip hop. Though many hip hop artists have embraced the ideals that effectively disenfranchize black female artists, many others choose to employ forms of resistance that counteract these negative portrayals of women in hip hop and offer a different narrative. These artists seek to expand ways of traditional thinking through different ways of cultural expression. In this effort they hope to elicit a response to female hip hop artists not with a misogynist lens but with one that validates women's struggle.Many have written about these intersections of hip-hop and feminism. One such example is Savannah Shange's article on Nicki Minaj entitled A King Named Nicki: Strategic queerness and the black femmecee. In her article, Shange discusses the inability to categorize Nicki Minaj's music as either specifically hetero or homosexual. She ways that Nicki uses a sort of strategic queerness to that uses her sex appeal both ways to attract her audience. Shange writes how even when looking at Nicki's music and persona from a homonormative lens, she defies categorization. She goes on to describe how Minaj \\\"is a rapper whose critical, strategic performance of queer femininity is inextricable linked to the production and reception of their rhymes.\\\" In this way, Nicki Minaj's performative style enables her to make similarly great strides as those who came before her.\\nFor women, artists such as Missy Elliott, Lil' Kim, Young M.A. and others are providing mentorship for new female MCs. In addition, there is a vibrant scene outside the mainstream that provides an opportunity for women and their music to flourish. Rap music has the power to influence how we view black women in our society. Queen Latifah used her award-winning song \\\"U.N.I.T.Y.\\\" to support to other women and to inform of the presence of women in the hip hop genre. However, many contemporary females in hip hop do not embody this mindset and counteract it. In 2014, Iggy Azalea was the first White female rapper to go mainstream and was the first White female rapper to have a number-one hit with \\\"Fancy\\\" in history.\\n\\n\\n== Current hip hop ==\\nFamous rappers as of today are Lil Uzi Vert, Meek Mill, Lil Pump, Kodak Black, Drake, Nicki Minaj, Tory Lanez, Rae Sremmurd, Chief Keef, Lil Wayne, Lil Yachty, Cardi B. Atlanta rappers such as Playboi Carti, Lil Yachty, Migos, 21 Savage, Young Thug, Rich the Kid and Future are very popular as of the 2010s.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\n\\nList of hip hop music festivals\\nList of hip hop genres\\nList of hip hop albums considered to be influential\\nList of hip hop musicians\\nList of deceased hip hop artists\\nList of films with associated hip hop songs\\nCORE Music Foundation\\nPop culture\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== Bibliography ==\\n\\n\\n== Further reading ==\\nChang, Jeff.

Wolf received generally positive reviews from critics and debuted at number three on the US Billboard 200, selling 89,000 copies in its first week.\\n\\n\\n== Background and production ==\\nIn November 2011, in an interview with Spin, Tyler expressed wanting to shift away from the themes of his previous albums, stating: \\n\\n\\n== Music and lyrics ==\\nThematically, Wolf slightly departs from the horrorcore lyrics of debut mixtape Bastard and debut studio album Goblin. It is a concept album that features a continuous story of characters Wolf, Sam and Salem. Therapist character Dr. TC makes his last appearance on a Tyler album on the final track \\\"Lone\\\". The story presented in Wolf has been said to link to Tyler's two previous projects, with debates occurring on whether Wolf comes chronologically before or after Goblin.Craig Jenkins of Pitchfork describes the track \\\"IFHY\\\" as \\\"a bit of Neptunes worship so adroit that its plinking synths and jazzy chord changes give way to a falsettoed coda from Pharrell himself\\\". Jenkins also compared the posse cut \\\"Rusty\\\" to the sound of Wu-Tang Clan, featuring \\\"a lush reimagining of 1990s RZA production\\\". \\\"Trashwang\\\" has been described as a tongue-in-cheek spoof of rapper Waka Flocka Flame's 2011 song \\\"Turnt Up Niggaz\\\". Kathy Iandoli of Billboard compared the song \\\"Colossus\\\" to Eminem's 2000 hit, \\\"Stan\\\", stating that Tyler \\\"continuously switches the lyrics from being cutesy fanfare to sexually maniacal\\\".\\n\\n\\n== Release and promotion ==\\nOn February 14, 2013, OFWGKTA posted a video to their YouTube account, which includes L-Boy skydiving and stating that Wolf will be released on April 2, 2013. On the same day, Tyler revealed three different album covers via his Instagram account. The deluxe version of the album features a fold-out poster of the full album cover artwork that was designed by Mark Ryden, a limited embroidered patch, a Wolf calendar and a 24-page booklet featuring lyrics and artwork. Four days after the album's release, Tyler released the whole album for free streaming services through his SoundCloud account.From March 11, 2013 to April 11, 2013, Tyler toured North America and Europe on the Wolf tour. The tour was his first solo tour without his group Odd Future. His first stop was Boulder, Colorado and the Wolf release party took place in Los Angeles, California on the release day of the album. He announced he would extend the tour from April 30 to May 18, 2013. These shows took place on the west coast of the United States and it features his Odd Future cohort, Earl Sweatshirt. On September 9, 2013, Tyler released a trailer for a film based on Wolf.\\n\\n\\n=== Singles ===\\nThe album's lead single, \\\"Domo23\\\", was released on February 14, 2013, as well an accompanying music video which features cameo appearances from Odd Future members Domo Genesis, Earl Sweatshirt, Jasper Dolphin and Taco. The song peaked at number two on the US Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles and at number 37 on the US Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs. At the end of the video for \\\"Domo23\\\", it previewed the video for the reported second single, \\\"Bimmer\\\" featuring Odd Future member Frank Ocean.\\n\\n\\n=== Other songs ===\\nOn March 29, 2013, the music video was released for \\\"IFHY\\\" featuring Pharrell. At the end of the video, the song cuts into a snippet of the music video for \\\"Jamba\\\" featuring Odd Future member Hodgy Beats. In the music video, Tyler \\\"plays a lovestruck doll, acting out scenes in a dollhouse with a plastic girlfriend. While the real-life Tyler later drives through a neighborhood with Hodgy Beats as his song \\\"Jamba\\\" blasts from the speakers.\\\" \\\"IFHY\\\" peaked at number 24 on the US Heatseekers Songs. On October 7, 2013, the music video was released for both \\\"Tamale\\\" and \\\"Answer\\\".\\n\\n\\n== Critical reception ==\\nWolf received generally positive reviews from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album has received an average score of 70, based on 31 reviews. Craig Jenkins of Pitchfork said, \\\"With Wolf, Tyler, the Creator displays a radical growth as a producer, composer and arranger, even if, as a rapper, he's still up to some of the same antics. Still, the album contains a few of the best songs he's ever written.\\\" Jeremy D. Larson of Consequence of Sound said, \\\"Tyler is his own worst enemy, of course. But the buoyancy of the production and the overall intrigue of hearing him struggle with his idle hands prevent the album from getting mired down in too much vanity.\\\" David Jeffries of AllMusic said, \\\"It's a fun album for fanatics, but the willingness to shock feels too comfortable at this point, so those who found it tiresome before will likely find it devastating here.\\\" Chris Dart of Exclaim! felt that \\\"While Tyler will almost certainly never outgrow life as a weird, hell-raising provocateur, Wolf shows that he's already growing into life as a smart, diverse artist.\\\"Slant Magazine's Jesse Cataldo commenting \\\"The production is routinely strong, but things are weighed down by Tyler himself, who forcefully refuses to provide a palatable anchor to over an hour's worth of material.\\\" Cataldo saw the album as \\\"progress on some fronts\\\", but felt that Tyler \\\"needs to move beyond certain issues\\\" to \\\"prove himself a vital force.\\\" Martin Caballero of The Boston Globe said, \\\"Despite careering from one alter ego to the next and touching on everything from his absent father on \\\"Answer\\\" to the art of making campfire s'mores on the seven-minute \\\"PartyIsntOver  / Campfire  / Bimmer\\\", there's a broad vision and deft execution that holds things together much better than on Goblin.\\\" Eric Diep of XXL said, \\\"Wolf meets its own high expectations by creating an absorbing journey of Tyler's imagination. Everything from being his own therapist to poking fun at newfound fame is documented in captivating fashion, however juvenile it may be at times. There's still growing up to do, and maybe time will tame the fascinating artist we see on this album. Until then, there's no escaping his meteoric rise. And the diehard Odd Future fans will love every minute of it.\\\"David Amidon of PopMatters said, \\\"If Wolf is not Goblin is the most important statement I feel like I could make about this album, the second most important thing I can probably say about it is that nothing has actually changed about Tyler himself. All his flaws as a coherent lyricist and person are on full display throughout the album, and the charm or lack thereof of that fact goes a long way towards how enjoyable this album can be.\\\" Jessica Hopper of Spin magazine felt that \\\"Wolf's most grievous misstep, and its one true spiritual connection to the superior Bastard and Goblin: Tyler's defiant use of the word 'faggot.' As usual, he spends a ton of time here bragging about how little he cares about how the world sees him, but his reliance on the other f-bomb to keep our attention suggests otherwise.\\\" Chris Kelly of Fact said, \\\"With Wolf, Tyler, the Creator is exciting again: maybe not as the ringleader of the Odd Future empire, but as a producer who just turned 22 (did you forget how young he actually is?), has internalized a decade of Neptunes / Doom / Def Jux production, and has Pharrell, Erykah, and (most importantly) Frank Ocean on speed dial. The don't-give-a-fuck attitude might have run its course lyrically, but when applying it as a production ethos, Tyler is just getting started.\\\"\\n\\n\\n=== Accolades ===\\nXXL ranked it at number 18 on their list of the best albums of 2013. They commented saying, \\\"The leader of the Odd Future crew's second album Wolf displayed radical maturity--both musically and lyrically; partnering with fellow Odd Future members Frank Ocean and Earl Sweatshirt, alongside Pharrell Williams and even Erykah Badu on songs involving gripping narratives of personal frustrations and heartbreak. Coupled with vivid lyrics and stark synth production, Tyler's fascinatingly still weird but insightful and musically pleasing.\\\" HipHopDX named it one of the top 25 albums of 2013. They elaborated saying, \\\"Wolf was Tyler's most grown up effort to date. Developing into a fully realized production mastermind, he somehow tied a summer camp story in with his usual themes of relationships and the struggles of fame, not to mention the ghetto's crack epidemic and bullying leading to school shootings.\\\"\\n\\n\\n== Commercial performance ==\\nIn the United States, Wolf debuted at number three on the US Billboard 200, selling 89,000 copies in the first week. In its second week, the album sold 18,000 more copies bringing its sales total to 107,000 in the United States.\\n\\n\\n== Track listing ==\\nAll songs produced by Tyler, the Creator, except for the final track \\\"Lone\\\", which is produced by Wilson das Neves.\\nNotes\\n\\n\\\"Jamba\\\" contains an uncredited appearance from Domo Genesis\\n\\\"Cowboy\\\" contains an uncredited appearance from Lego-Head\\n\\\"Awkward\\\" and \\\"48\\\" contain uncredited appearances from Frank Ocean\\n\\\"48\\\" contains an uncredited appearance from Nas\\n\\\"Rusty\\\" contains an uncredited appearance from Jason Dill\\nSyd tha Kyd is uncredited with contributing vocals on \\\"Answer\\\"\\nElijah Hall, Parys Hall and Jaslyn Leonti are uncredited with contributing vocals on \\\"Campfire\\\"\\nTallullah Willis is uncredited with contributing vocals on \\\"Tamale\\\"\\n\\n\\n== Personnel ==\\nCredits for Wolf adapted from AllMusic.\\n\\n\\n== Charts ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\", \"rev_id\": 857287885, \"accessed\": \"2018-09-03 00:23:59.864295\", \"links\": [\"RED Distribution\", \"Billboard (magazine)\", \"AllMusic\", \"Wu-Tang Clan\", \"Consequence of Sound\", \"Pitchfork (website)\", \"Fact (UK magazine)\", \"Single (music)\", \"The Boston Globe\", \"Los Angeles\", \"Jasper Dolphin\", \"Mark Ryden\", \"Domo Genesis\", \"Pharrell Williams\", \"Heatseekers Songs\", \"Odd Future\", \"Waka Flocka Flame\", \"Left Brain\", \"Boulder, Colorado\", \"YouTube\", \"HipHopDX\", \"Odd Future Records\", \"Domo23\", \"Syd tha Kyd\", \"Earl Sweatshirt\", \"Tyler, the Creator\", \"Genesis (Domo Genesis album)\", \"Spin (magazine)\", \"Earl (mixtape)\", \"Bastard (Tyler, the Creator album)\", \"Erykah Badu\", \"Instagram\", \"Frank Ocean\", \"Hodgy\", \"Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles\", \"Bastard (Tyler, The Creator album)\", \"Exclaim!\", \"Goblin (album)\", \"RZA\", \"Stan (song)\", \"XXL (magazine)\", \"Mike G\", \"Syd (singer)\", \"Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs\", \"Metacritic\", \"Eminem\", \"PopMatters\", \"Wilson das Neves\", \"Slant Magazine\", \"Bastard (Tyler, the Creator mixtape)\", \"Billboard 200\", \"SoundCloud\", \"Wolf (Tyler, The Creator album)\", \"Nas\"]}, {\"title\": \"Dash Radio\", \"link_id\": \"Dash Radio\", \"summary\": \"Dash Radio is a digital radio broadcasting platform with 80 original stations.

The city has many nicknames, the best known being the Windy City and Chi-Town.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\n\\n=== Beginnings ===\\n\\nThe name \\\"Chicago\\\" is derived from a French rendering of the indigenous Miami-Illinois word shikaakwa for a wild relative of the onion, known to botanists as Allium tricoccum. The first known reference to the site of the current city of Chicago as \\\"Checagou\\\" was by Robert de LaSalle around 1679 in a memoir. Henri Joutel, in his journal of 1688, noted that the eponymous wild \\\"garlic\\\" grew abundantly in the area. According to his diary of late September 1687:\\n\\nwhen we arrived at the said place called \\\"Chicagou\\\" which, according to what we were able to learn of it, has taken this name because of the quantity of garlic which grows in the forests in this region.\\nIn the mid-18th century, the area was inhabited by a Native American tribe known as the Potawatomi, who had taken the place of the Miami and Sauk and Fox peoples. The first known non-indigenous permanent settler in Chicago was Jean Baptiste Point du Sable. Du Sable was of African and French descent and arrived in the 1780s. He is commonly known as the \\\"Founder of Chicago\\\".\\nIn 1795, following the Northwest Indian War, an area that was to be part of Chicago was turned over to the United States for a military post by native tribes in accordance with the Treaty of Greenville. In 1803, the United States Army built Fort Dearborn, which was destroyed in 1812 in the Battle of Fort Dearborn and later rebuilt. The Ottawa, Ojibwe, and Potawatomi tribes had ceded additional land to the United States in the 1816 Treaty of St. Louis. The Potawatomi were forcibly removed from their land after the Treaty of Chicago in 1833.\\n\\n\\n=== Founding and 19th century ===\\n\\nIn the early 1790s Jean Baptiste Du Sable had settled at the mouth of the North Bank of the Chicago River, and is identified as a National Historic Landmark, now located in Pioneer Court. He established an extensive and prosperous trading settlement in what would become the city of Chicago. He sold his Chicago River property in 1800 and moved to St. Charles, now in Missouri, where he was licensed to run a Missouri River ferry. Point du Sable's successful role in developing the Chicago River settlement was little recognized until the mid-20th century.\\nOn August 12, 1833, the Town of Chicago was organized with a population of about 200. Within seven years it grew to more than 4,000 people. On June 15, 1835, the first public land sales began with Edmund Dick Taylor as U.S. Receiver of Public Monies. The City of Chicago was incorporated on Saturday, March 4, 1837, and for several decades was the world's fastest-growing city.As the site of the Chicago Portage, the city became an important transportation hub between the eastern and western United States. Chicago's first railway, Galena and Chicago Union Railroad, and the Illinois and Michigan Canal opened in 1848. The canal allowed steamboats and sailing ships on the Great Lakes to connect to the Mississippi River.A flourishing economy brought residents from rural communities and immigrants from abroad. Manufacturing and retail and finance sectors became dominant, influencing the American economy. The Chicago Board of Trade (established 1848) listed the first-ever standardized \\\"exchange-traded\\\" forward contracts, which were called futures contracts.\\n\\nIn the 1850s, Chicago gained national political prominence as the home of Senator Stephen Douglas, the champion of the Kansas-Nebraska Act and the \\\"popular sovereignty\\\" approach to the issue of the spread of slavery. These issues also helped propel another Illinoisan, Abraham Lincoln, to the national stage. Lincoln was nominated in Chicago for US President at the 1860 Republican National Convention, which was held in Chicago in a temporary building called the Wigwam. He defeated Douglas in the general election, and this set the stage for the American Civil War.\\nTo accommodate rapid population growth and demand for better sanitation, the city improved its infrastructure. In February 1856, Chicago's Common Council approved Chesbrough's plan to build the United States' first comprehensive sewerage system. The project raised much of central Chicago to a new grade. While elevating Chicago, and at first improving the city's health, the untreated sewage and industrial waste now flowed into the Chicago River, and subsequently into Lake Michigan, polluting the city's primary freshwater source.\\nThe city responded by tunneling two miles (3.2 km) out into Lake Michigan to newly built water cribs. In 1900, the problem of sewage contamination was largely resolved when the city completed a major engineering feat. It reversed the flow of the Chicago River so that the water flowed away from Lake Michigan rather than into it. This project began with the construction and improvement of the Illinois and Michigan Canal, and was completed with the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal that connects to the Illinois River, which flows into the Mississippi River.In 1871, the Great Chicago Fire destroyed an area about 4 miles (6.4 km) long and 1-mile (1.6 km) wide, a large section of the city at the time. Much of the city, including railroads and stockyards, survived intact, and from the ruins of the previous wooden structures arose more modern constructions of steel and stone. These set a precedent for worldwide construction. During its rebuilding period, Chicago constructed the world's first skyscraper in 1885, using steel-skeleton construction.The city has grown significantly in size and population by incorporating many neighboring townships between 1851 and 1920, with the largest annexation happening in 1889, with five townships joining the city, including the Hyde Park Township, which now comprises most of the South Side of Chicago and the far southeast of Chicago, and the Jefferson Township, which now makes up most of Chicago's Northwest Side. The desire to join the city was driven by municipal services that the city could provide its residents.\\n\\nChicago's flourishing economy attracted huge numbers of new immigrants from Europe and migrants from the Eastern United States. Of the total population in 1900, more than 77% were either foreign-born or born in the United States of foreign parentage. Germans, Irish, Poles, Swedes and Czechs made up nearly two-thirds of the foreign-born population (by 1900, whites were 98.1% of the city's population).Labor conflicts followed the industrial boom and the rapid expansion of the labor pool, including the Haymarket affair on May 4, 1886, and in 1894 the Pullman Strike. Anarchist and socialist groups played prominent roles in creating very large and highly organized labor actions. Concern for social problems among Chicago's immigrant poor led Jane Addams and Ellen Gates Starr to found Hull House in 1889. Programs that were developed there became a model for the new field of social work.During the 1870s and 1880s, Chicago attained national stature as the leader in the movement to improve public health. City, and later, state laws that upgraded standards for the medical profession and fought urban epidemics of cholera, smallpox, and yellow fever were both passed and enforced. These laws became templates for public health reform in other cities and states.The city established many large, well-landscaped municipal parks, which also included public sanitation facilities. The chief advocate for improving public health in Chicago was Dr. John H. Rauch, M.D. Rauch established a plan for Chicago's park system in 1866. He created Lincoln Park by closing a cemetery filled with shallow graves, and in 1867, in response to an outbreak of cholera he helped establish a new Chicago Board of Health. Ten years later, he became the secretary and then the president of the first Illinois State Board of Health, which carried out most of its activities in Chicago.In the 1800s, Chicago became the nation's railroad center, and by 1910 over 20 railroads operated passenger service out of six different downtown terminals. In 1883, Chicago's railway managers needed a general time convention, so they developed the standardized system of North American time zones. This system for telling time spread throughout the continent.\\nIn 1893, Chicago hosted the World's Columbian Exposition on former marshland at the present location of Jackson Park. The Exposition drew 27.5 million visitors, and is considered the most influential world's fair in history. The University of Chicago, formerly at another location, moved to the same South Side location in 1892. The term \\\"midway\\\" for a fair or carnival referred originally to the Midway Plaisance, a strip of park land that still runs through the University of Chicago campus and connects the Washington and Jackson Parks.\\n\\n\\n=== 20th and 21st centuries ===\\n\\n\\n==== 1900 to 1939 ====\\n\\nDuring World War I and the 1920s there was a major expansion in industry. The availability of jobs attracted African Americans from the Southern United States. Between 1910 and 1930, the African American population of Chicago increased dramatically, from 44,103 to 233,903. This Great Migration had an immense cultural impact, called the Chicago Black Renaissance, part of the New Negro Movement, in art, literature, and music. Continuing racial tensions and violence, such as the Chicago Race Riot of 1919, also occurred.The ratification of the 18th amendment to the Constitution in 1919 made the production and sale (including exportation) of alcoholic beverages illegal in the United States. This ushered in the beginning of what is known as the Gangster Era, a time that roughly spans from 1919 until 1933 when Prohibition was repealed. The 1920s saw gangsters, including Al Capone, Dion O'Banion, Bugs Moran and Tony Accardo battle law enforcement and each other on the streets of Chicago during the Prohibition era. Chicago was the location of the infamous St. Valentine's Day Massacre in 1929, when Al Capone sent men to gun down members of a rival gang, North Side, led by Bugs Moran.Chicago was the first American city to have a homosexual-rights organization. The organization, formed in 1924, was called the Society for Human Rights. It produced the first American publication for homosexuals, Friendship and Freedom. Police and political pressure caused the organization to disband.The Great Depression brought unprecedented suffering to Chicago, in no small part due to the city's heavy reliance on heavy industry. Notably, industrial areas on the south side and neighborhoods lining both branches of the Chicago River were devastated; by 1933 over 50% of industrial jobs in the city had been lost, and unemployment rates amongst blacks and Mexicans in the city were over 40%. The Republican political machine in Chicago was utterly destroyed by the economic crisis, and every mayor since 1931 has been a Democrat. From 1928 to 1933, the city witnessed a tax revolt, and the city was unable to meet payroll or provide relief efforts. Unemployed workers, relief recipients, and unpaid schoolteachers held huge demonstrations during the early years of the Great Depression.  The fiscal crisis was resolved by 1933, and at the same time, federal relief funding began to flow into Chicago and enabled the city to complete construction of Lake Shore Drive, landscape numerous parks, construct 30 new schools, and build a thoroughly modernized State Street Subway. Chicago was also a hotbed of labor activism, with Unemployed Councils contributing heavily in the early depression to create solidarity for the poor and demand relief, these organizations were created by socialist and communist groups. By 1935 the Workers Alliance of America begun organizing the poor, workers, the unemployed. In the spring of 1937 Republic Steel Works witnessed the Memorial Day massacre of 1937 in the neighborhood of East Side.\\nIn 1933, Chicago Mayor Anton Cermak was fatally wounded in Miami, Florida, during a failed assassination attempt on President-elect Franklin D. Roosevelt. In 1933 and 1934, the city celebrated its centennial by hosting the Century of Progress International Exposition Worlds Fair. The theme of the fair was technological innovation over the century since Chicago's founding.\\n\\n\\n==== 1940 to 1979 ====\\nWhen general prosperity returned in 1940, Chicago had an entrenched Democratic machine, a fully solvent city government, and a population that had enthusiastically shared mass culture and mass movements. Over one-third of the workers in Chicago's manufacturing sector were unionized. During World War II, the city of Chicago alone produced more steel than the United Kingdom every year from 1939 - 1945, and more than Nazi Germany from 1943 - 1945. The city's diversified industrial base made it second only to Detroit in the value--$24 billion--of war goods produced. Over 1,400 companies produced everything from field rations to parachutes to torpedoes, while new aircraft plants employed 100,000 in the construction of engines, aluminum sheeting, bombsights, and other components. The Great Migration, which had been on pause due to the Depression, resumed at an even faster pace as the 1910 - 1930 period, as hundreds of thousands of black Americans arrived in the city to work in the steel mills, railroads, and shipping yards.On December 2, 1942, physicist Enrico Fermi conducted the world's first controlled nuclear reaction at the University of Chicago as part of the top-secret Manhattan Project. This led to the creation of the atomic bomb by the United States, which it used in World War II in 1945.Mayor Richard J. Daley, a Democrat, was elected in 1955, in the era of machine politics. In 1956, the city conducted its last major expansion when it annexed the land under O'Hare airport, including a small portion of DuPage County.\\nBy the 1960s, white residents in several neighborhoods left the city for the suburban areas - in many American cities, a process known as white flight - as Blacks continued to move beyond the Black Belt. While home loan discriminatory redlining against blacks continued, the real estate industry practiced what became known as blockbusting, completely changing the racial composition of whole neighborhoods. Structural changes in industry, such as globalization and job outsourcing, caused heavy job losses for lower-skilled workers. At its peak during the 1960s, some 250,000 workers were employed in the steel industry in Chicago, but the steel crisis of the 1970s and 1980s reduced this number to just 28,000 in 2015. In 1966, Martin Luther King Jr. and Albert Raby led the Chicago Freedom Movement, which culminated in agreements between Mayor Richard J. Daley and the movement leaders.\\n\\nTwo years later, the city hosted the tumultuous 1968 Democratic National Convention, which featured physical confrontations both inside and outside the convention hall, with anti-war protesters, journalists and bystanders being beaten by police. Major construction projects, including the Sears Tower (now known as the Willis Tower, which in 1974 became the world's tallest building), University of Illinois at Chicago, McCormick Place, and O'Hare International Airport, were undertaken during Richard J. Daley's tenure. In 1979, Jane Byrne, the city's first female mayor, was elected. She helped reduce crime in the Cabrini-Green housing project and led Chicago's school system out of a financial crisis.\\n\\n\\n==== 1980 to present ====\\nIn 1983, Harold Washington became the first black mayor of Chicago. Washington's first term in office directed attention to poor and previously neglected minority neighborhoods. He was re-elected in 1987 but died of a heart attack soon after. Washington was succeeded by 6th ward Alderman Eugene Sawyer, who was elected by the Chicago City Council and served until a special election.\\nRichard M. Daley, son of Richard J. Daley, was elected in 1989. His accomplishments included improvements to parks and creating incentives for sustainable development, as well as closing Meigs Field in the middle of the night and destroying the runways. After successfully running for re-election five times, and becoming Chicago's longest-serving mayor, Richard M. Daley declined to run for a seventh term.In 1992, a construction accident near the Kinzie Street Bridge produced a breach connecting the Chicago River to a tunnel below, which was part of an abandoned freight tunnel system extending throughout the downtown Loop district. The tunnels filled with 250 million US gallons (1,000,000 m3) of water, affecting buildings throughout the district and forcing a shutdown of electrical power. The area was shut down for three days and some buildings did not reopen for weeks; losses were estimated at $1.95 billion.On February 23, 2011, former Illinois Congressman and White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel won the mayoral election, after defeating challenges that he was not a Chicago resident and beating five rivals with 55 percent of the vote alone, and was sworn in as Mayor on May 16, 2011.\\n\\n\\n== Geography ==\\n\\n\\n=== Topography ===\\n\\nChicago is located in northeastern Illinois on the southwestern shores of Lake Michigan. It is the principal city in the Chicago metropolitan area, situated in the Midwestern United States and the Great Lakes region. Chicago rests on a continental divide at the site of the Chicago Portage, connecting the Mississippi River and the Great Lakes watersheds. The city lies beside huge freshwater Lake Michigan, and two rivers--the Chicago River in downtown and the Calumet River in the industrial far South Side--flow entirely or partially through Chicago.\\nChicago's history and economy are closely tied to its proximity to Lake Michigan. While the Chicago River historically handled much of the region's waterborne cargo, today's huge lake freighters use the city's Lake Calumet Harbor on the South Side. The lake also provides another positive effect: moderating Chicago's climate, making waterfront neighborhoods slightly warmer in winter and cooler in summer.When Chicago was founded in 1837, most of the early building was around the mouth of the Chicago River, as can be seen on a map of the city's original 58 blocks. The overall grade of the city's central, built-up areas is relatively consistent with the natural flatness of its overall natural geography, generally exhibiting only slight differentiation otherwise. The average land elevation is 579 ft (176.5 m) above sea level. The lowest points are along the lake shore at 578 ft (176.2 m), while the highest point, at 672 ft (205 m), is the morainal ridge of Blue Island in the city's far south side.The Chicago Loop is the central business district, but Chicago is also a city of neighborhoods. Lake Shore Drive runs adjacent to a large portion of Chicago's waterfront. Some of the parks along the waterfront include Lincoln Park, Grant Park, Burnham Park and Jackson Park. There are twenty-four public beaches across 26 miles (42 km) of the waterfront. Landfill extends into portions of the lake providing space for Navy Pier, Northerly Island, the Museum Campus, and large portions of the McCormick Place Convention Center. Most of the city's high-rise commercial and residential buildings are close to the waterfront.\\nAn informal name for the entire Chicago metropolitan area is \\\"Chicagoland\\\", which generally means the city and all its suburbs. The Chicago Tribune, which coined the term, includes the city of Chicago, the rest of Cook County, eight nearby Illinois counties: Lake, McHenry, DuPage, Kane, Kendall, Grundy, Will and Kankakee, and three counties in Indiana: Lake, Porter and LaPorte. The Illinois Department of Tourism defines Chicagoland as Cook County without the city of Chicago, and only Lake, DuPage, Kane and Will counties. The Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce defines it as all of Cook and DuPage, Kane, Lake, McHenry and Will counties.\\n\\n\\n=== Communities ===\\n\\nMajor sections of the city include the central business district, called The Loop, and the North, the South, and West Sides. The three sides of the city are represented on the Flag of Chicago by three horizontal white stripes. The North Side is the most densely populated residential section of the city, and many high-rises are located on this side of the city along the lakefront. The South Side is the largest section of the city, encompassing roughly 60% of the city's land area. The South Side contains most of the facilities of the Port of Chicago.In the late 1920s, sociologists at the University of Chicago subdivided the city into 77 distinct community areas, which can further be subdivided into over 200 informally defined neighborhoods.\\n\\n\\n=== Streetscape ===\\n\\nChicago's streets were laid out in a street grid that grew from the city's original townsite plat, which was bounded by Lake Michigan on the east, North Avenue on the north, Wood Street on the west, and 22nd Street on the south. Streets following the Public Land Survey System section lines later became arterial streets in outlying sections. As new additions to the city were platted, city ordinance required them to be laid out with eight streets to the mile in one direction and sixteen in the other direction (about one street per 200 meters in one direction and one street per 100 meters in the other direction). The grid's regularity provided an efficient means of developing new real estate property. A scattering of diagonal streets, many of them originally Native American trails, also cross the city (Elston, Milwaukee, Ogden, Lincoln, etc.). Many additional diagonal streets were recommended in the Plan of Chicago, but only the extension of Ogden Avenue was ever constructed.In 2016, Chicago was ranked the sixth-most walkable large city in the United States. Many of the city's residential streets have a wide patch of grass and/or trees between the street and the sidewalk itself. This helps to keep pedestrians on the sidewalk further away from the street traffic. Chicago's Western Avenue is the longest continuous urban street in the world. Other famous streets include Michigan Avenue, State Street, Clark Street, and Belmont Avenue. The City Beautiful movement inspired Chicago's boulevards and parkways.\\n\\n\\n=== Architecture ===\\n\\nThe destruction caused by the Great Chicago Fire led to the largest building boom in the history of the nation. In 1885, the first steel-framed high-rise building, the Home Insurance Building, rose in the city as Chicago ushered in the skyscraper era, which would then be followed by many other cities around the world. Today, Chicago's skyline is among the world's tallest and densest.Some of the United States' tallest towers are located in Chicago; Willis Tower (formerly Sears Tower) is the second tallest building in the Western Hemisphere after One World Trade Center, and Trump International Hotel and Tower is the third tallest in the country. The Loop's historic buildings include the Chicago Board of Trade Building, the Fine Arts Building, 35 East Wacker, and the Chicago Building, 860-880 Lake Shore Drive Apartments by Mies van der Rohe. Many other architects have left their impression on the Chicago skyline such as Daniel Burnham, Louis Sullivan, Charles B. Atwood, John Root, and Helmut Jahn.The Merchandise Mart, once first on the list of largest buildings in the world, currently listed as 44th-largest (as of September 9, 2013), had its own zip code until 2008, and stands near the junction of the North and South branches of the Chicago River. Presently, the four tallest buildings in the city are Willis Tower (formerly the Sears Tower, also a building with its own zip code), Trump International Hotel and Tower, the Aon Center (previously the Standard Oil Building), and the John Hancock Center. Industrial districts, such as some areas on the South Side, the areas along the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal, and the Northwest Indiana area are clustered.Chicago gave its name to the Chicago School and was home to the Prairie School, two movements in architecture. Multiple kinds and scales of houses, townhouses, condominiums, and apartment buildings can be found throughout Chicago. Large swaths of the city's residential areas away from the lake are characterized by brick bungalows built from the early 20th century through the end of World War II. Chicago is also a prominent center of the Polish Cathedral style of church architecture. The Chicago suburb of Oak Park was home to famous architect Frank Lloyd Wright, who had designed The Robie House located near the University of Chicago.A popular tourist activity is to take an architecture boat tour along the Chicago River.\\n\\n\\n=== Monuments and public art ===\\n\\nChicago is famous for its outdoor public art with donors establishing funding for such art as far back as Benjamin Ferguson's 1905 trust. A number of Chicago's public art works are by modern figurative artists.

Summers are warm to hot and often humid, with a July daily average of 75.8 degF (24.3 degC). In a normal summer, temperatures can exceed 90 degF (32 degC) as many as 21 days. Winters are cold and snowy, although the city typically sees less snow and rain in winter than that experienced on the East Coast; blizzards do occur, as in 2011. There are many sunny but cold days in winter. The normal winter high from December through March is about 36 degF, with January and February being the coldest months and when, on occasion, overnight temperatures can drop below zero degrees Fahrenheit.

Like other major cities, Chicago also experiences urban heat island, making the city and its suburbs milder than surrounding rural areas, especially at night and in winter. Also, the proximity to Lake Michigan tends to keep lakefront Chicago somewhat cooler in summer and not as brutally cold in winter than areas away from the lake, while sometimes experiencing lake-effect snow.\\n\\n\\n== Demographics ==\\n\\nDuring its first hundred years, Chicago was one of the fastest-growing cities in the world. When founded in 1833, fewer than 200 people had settled on what was then the American frontier. By the time of its first census, seven years later, the population had reached over 4,000. In the forty years from 1850 to 1890, the city's population grew from slightly under 30,000 to over 1 million. At the end of the 19th century, Chicago was the fifth-largest city in the world, and the largest of the cities that did not exist at the dawn of the century. Within sixty years of the Great Chicago Fire of 1871, the population went from about 300,000 to over 3 million, and reached its highest ever recorded population of 3.6 million for the 1950 census.\\nFrom the last two decades of the 19th century, Chicago was the destination of waves of immigrants from Ireland, Southern, Central and Eastern Europe, including Italians, Jews, Poles, Lithuanians, Bulgarians, Albanians, Croatians, Serbs, Bosnians, Montenegrins and Czechs. To these ethnic groups, the basis of the city's industrial working class, were added an additional influx of African Americans from the American South--with Chicago's black population doubling between 1910 and 1920 and doubling again between 1920 and 1930.In the 1920s and 1930s, the great majority of blacks moving to Chicago settled in a so-called \\\"Black Belt\\\" on the city's South Side.

In the Encyclopedia of Chicago, Northwestern University Professor Bill Savage describes Chicago fiction as prose which tries to \\\"capture the essence of the city, its spaces and its people\\\". The challenge for early writers was that Chicago was a frontier outpost that transformed into a global metropolis in the span of two generations. Narrative fiction of that time, much of it in the style of \\\"high-flown romance\\\" and \\\"genteel realism\\\", needed a new approach to describe the urban social, political, and economic conditions of Chicago. Nonetheless, Chicagoans worked hard to create a literary tradition that would stand the test of time, and create a \\\"city of feeling\\\" out of concrete, steel, vast lake, and open prairie. Much notable Chicago fiction focuses on the city itself, with social criticism keeping exultation in check.\\nAt least, three short periods in the history of Chicago have had a lasting influence on American Literature.

They have won three World Series titles, including the 2016 World Series, but had the dubious honor of having the two longest droughts in American professional sports: They had not won their sport's title since 1908, and had not participated in a World Series since 1945, both records, until they beat the Cleveland Indians in the 2016 World Series.\\nThe White Sox have played on the South Side continuously since 1901, with all three of their home fields throughout the years being within blocks of one another. They have won three World Series titles (1906, 1917, 2005) and six American League pennants, including the first in 1901. The Sox are fifth in the American League in all-time wins, and sixth in pennants.\\nThe Chicago Bears, one of the last two remaining charter members of the National Football League (NFL), have won nine NFL Championships, including the 1985 Super Bowl XX. The other remaining charter franchise, the Chicago Cardinals, also started out in the city, but is now known as the Arizona Cardinals. The Bears have won more games in the history of the NFL than any other team, and only the Green Bay Packers, their longtime rivals, have won more championships. The Bears play their home games at Soldier Field. Soldier Field re-opened in 2003 after an extensive renovation.\\n\\nThe Chicago Bulls of the National Basketball Association (NBA) is one of the most recognized basketball teams in the world. During the 1990s, with Michael Jordan leading them, the Bulls won six NBA championships in eight seasons. They also boast the youngest player to win the NBA Most Valuable Player Award, Derrick Rose, who won it for the 2010-11 season.The Chicago Blackhawks of the National Hockey League (NHL) began play in 1926, and are one of the \\\"Original Six\\\" teams of the NHL. The Blackhawks have won six Stanley Cups, including in 2010, 2013, and 2015. Both the Bulls and the Blackhawks play at the United Center.\\n\\nThe Chicago Fire Soccer Club is a member of Major League Soccer (MLS) and plays at Toyota Park in suburban Bridgeview, after playing its first eight seasons at Soldier Field. The Fire have won one league title and four U.S. Open Cups, since their founding in 1997. In 1994, the United States hosted a successful FIFA World Cup with games played at Soldier Field.\\nChicago will be home to a new USL team starting in 2020. They plan to play in a 20,000 seat stadium located in Lincoln Park. The Chicago Sky is a professional basketball team based in Rosemont, Illinois, playing in the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA). They play home games at the Allstate Arena. The team was founded before the 2006 WNBA season began.\\nThe Chicago Marathon has been held each year since 1977 except for 1987, when a half marathon was run in its place. The Chicago Marathon is one of six World Marathon Majors.Five area colleges play in Division I conferences: two from major conferences--the DePaul Blue Demons (Big East Conference) and the Northwestern Wildcats (Big Ten Conference)--and three from other D1 conferences--the Chicago State Cougars (Western Athletic Conference); the Loyola Ramblers (Missouri Valley Conference); and the UIC Flames (Horizon League).\\n\\n\\n== Parks and greenspace ==\\n\\nWhen Chicago was incorporated in 1837, it chose the motto Urbs in Horto, a Latin phrase which means \\\"City in a Garden\\\". Today, the Chicago Park District consists of more than 570 parks with over 8,000 acres (3,200 ha) of municipal parkland. There are 31 sand beaches, a plethora of museums, two world-class conservatories, and 50 nature areas. Lincoln Park, the largest of the city's parks, covers 1,200 acres (490 ha) and has over 20 million visitors each year, making it third in the number of visitors after Central Park in New York City, and the National Mall and Memorial Parks in Washington, D.C.There is a historic boulevard system, a network of wide, tree-lined boulevards which connect a number of Chicago parks. The boulevards and the parks were authorized by the Illinois legislature in 1869. A number of Chicago neighborhoods emerged along these roadways in the 19th century. The building of the boulevard system continued intermittently until 1942. It includes nineteen boulevards, eight parks, and six squares, along twenty-six miles of interconnected streets. Part of the system in the Logan Square Boulevards Historic District was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1985.With berths for more than 6,000 boats, the Chicago Park District operates the nation's largest municipal harbor system. In addition to ongoing beautification and renewal projects for the existing parks, a number of new parks have been added in recent years, such as the Ping Tom Memorial Park in Chinatown, DuSable Park on the Near North Side, and most notably, Millennium Park, which is in the northwestern corner of one of Chicago's oldest parks, Grant Park in the Chicago Loop.\\nThe wealth of greenspace afforded by Chicago's parks is further augmented by the Cook County Forest Preserves, a network of open spaces containing forest, prairie, wetland, streams, and lakes that are set aside as natural areas which lie along the city's outskirts, including both the Chicago Botanic Garden in Glencoe and the Brookfield Zoo in Brookfield. Washington Park is also one of the city's biggest parks; covering nearly 400 acres (160 ha). The park is listed on the National Register of Historic Places listings in South Side Chicago.\\n\\n\\n== Law and government ==\\n\\n\\n=== Government ===\\n\\nThe government of the City of Chicago is divided into executive and legislative branches. The Mayor of Chicago is the chief executive, elected by general election for a term of four years, with no term limits. The current mayor is Rahm Emanuel. The mayor appoints commissioners and other officials who oversee the various departments. As well as the mayor, Chicago's clerk and treasurer are also elected citywide. The City Council is the legislative branch and is made up of 50 aldermen, one elected from each ward in the city. The council takes official action through the passage of ordinances and resolutions and approves the city budget.The Chicago Police Department provides law enforcement and the Chicago Fire Department provides fire suppression and emergency medical services for the city and its residents. Civil and criminal law cases are heard in the Cook County Circuit Court of the State of Illinois court system, or in the Northern District of Illinois, in the federal system. In the state court, the public prosecutor is the Illinois State's Attorney; in the Federal court it is the United States Attorney.\\n\\n\\n=== Politics ===\\n\\nDuring much of the last half of the 19th century, Chicago's politics were dominated by a growing Democratic Party organization. During the 1880s and 1890s, Chicago had a powerful radical tradition with large and highly organized socialist, anarchist and labor organizations. For much of the 20th century, Chicago has been among the largest and most reliable Democratic strongholds in the United States; with Chicago's Democratic vote the state of Illinois has been \\\"solid blue\\\" in presidential elections since 1992. Even before then, it was not unheard of for Republican presidential candidates to win handily in downstate Illinois, only to lose statewide due to large Democratic margins in Chicago. The citizens of Chicago have not elected a Republican mayor since 1927, when William Thompson was voted into office. The strength of the party in the city is partly a consequence of Illinois state politics, where the Republicans have come to represent rural and farm concerns while the Democrats support urban issues such as Chicago's public school funding.\\nChicago contains less than 25% of the state's population, but it is split between eight of Illinois' 19 districts in the United States House of Representatives. All eight of the city's representatives are Democrats; a Republican has only represented a significant portion of the city twice since 1973, for one term each-Robert P. Hanrahan from 1973 to 1975, and Michael Patrick Flanagan from 1995 to 1997.\\nMachine politics persisted in Chicago after the decline of similar machines in other large U.S. cities. During much of that time, the city administration found opposition mainly from a liberal \\\"independent\\\" faction of the Democratic Party. The independents finally gained control of city government in 1983 with the election of Harold Washington (in office 1983-1987). From 1989 until May 16, 2011, Chicago was under the leadership of its longest serving mayor, Richard M. Daley, the son of Richard J. Daley. On May 16, 2011, Rahm Emanuel was sworn in as the 55th mayor of Chicago. Because of the dominance of the Democratic Party in Chicago, the Democratic primary vote held in the spring is generally more significant than the general elections in November for U.S. House and Illinois State seats. The aldermanic, mayoral, and other city offices are filled through nonpartisan elections with runoffs as needed.\\nFormerly a state legislator representing Chicago and later a US Senator, the city is home of former United States President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama. The Obamas' residence is located near the University of Chicago in Kenwood on the city's south side.\\n\\n\\n=== Crime ===\\n\\nChicago had a murder rate of 18.5 per 100,000 residents in 2012, ranking 16th among US cities with 100,000 people or more. This was higher than in New York City and Los Angeles, the two largest cities in the United States, which have lower murder rates and lower total homicides. However, it was less than in many smaller American cities, including New Orleans, Newark, and Detroit, which had 53 murders per 100,000 residents in 2012. The 2015 year-end crime statistics showed there were 468 murders in Chicago in 2015 compared with 416 the year before, a 12.5% increase, as well as 2,900 shootings--13% more than the year prior, and up 29% since 2013. Chicago had more homicides than any other city in 2015 in total but not on per capita basis, according to the Chicago Tribune.  In its annual crime statistics for 2016, the Chicago Police Department reported that the city experienced a dramatic rise in gun violence, with 4,331 shooting victims. The department also reported 762 murders in Chicago for the year 2016, a total that marked a 62.79% increase in homicides from 2015.  In June 2017, the Chicago Police Department and the Federal ATF announced a new task force, similar to past task forces, to address the flow of illegal guns and repeat offenses with guns.According to reports in 2013, \\\"most of Chicago's violent crime comes from gangs trying to maintain control of drug-selling territories\\\", and is specifically related to the activities of the Sinaloa Cartel, which by 2006 had decided to seek to control illicit drug distribution, against local street gangs. Violent crime rates vary significantly by area of the city, with more economically developed areas having low rates, but other sections have much higher rates of crime. In 2013, the violent crime rate was 910 per 100,000 people; the murder rate was 10.4 - while high crime districts saw 38.9, low crime districts saw 2.5 murders per 100,000.The number of murders in Chicago peaked at 970 in 1974, when the city's population was over 3 million people (a murder rate of about 29 per 100,000), and it reached 943 murders in 1992, (a murder rate of 34 per 100,000). However, Chicago, like other major U.S. cities, experienced a significant reduction in violent crime rates through the 1990s, falling to 448 homicides in 2004, its lowest total since 1965 and only 15.65 murders per 100,000. Chicago's homicide tally remained low during 2005 (449), 2006 (452), and 2007 (435) but rose to 510 in 2008, breaking 500 for the first time since 2003. In 2009, the murder count fell to 458 (10% down). and in 2010 Chicago's murder rate fell to 435 (16.14 per 100,000), a 5% decrease from 2009 and lowest levels since 1965. In 2011, Chicago's murders fell another 1.2% to 431 (a rate of 15.94 per 100,000). but shot up to 506 in 2012.In 2012, Chicago ranked 21st in the United States in numbers of homicides per person, but in the first half of 2013 there was a significant drop per-person, in all categories of violent crime, including homicide (down 26%). Chicago ended 2013 with 415 murders, the lowest number of murders since 1965, and overall crime rates dropped by 16 percent. (In 1965, there were 397 murders.) In 2013 Chicago was falsely named the \\\"Murder Capitol\\\" even through the murder rate was only slightly higher than the national average. It was also nicknamed Chiraq by Chicago drill rappers.  According to police, the nickname was first heard in 2010. At that time, the murder rate was historically low for Chicago. According to FBI St. Louis, New Orleans, Detroit and Baltimore\\nhad the highest murder rate.\\nJens Ludwig, director of the University of Chicago Crime Lab, estimated that shootings cost the city of Chicago $2.5 billion in 2012.\\n\\n\\n=== Police Brutality Lawsuit Settlements ===\\nIn 2016, it was reported by The Better Government Association, a local watchdog group, that since 2004 Chicago has paid more than $500 million to settle police misconduct cases. The 2014 shooting of Laquan McDonald resulted in a  $5 million settlement from the city and a sparked a federal Department of Justice investigation into widespread police misconduct.\\n\\n\\n=== Employee pensions ===\\nIn September 2016, an Illinois state appellate court found that cities do not have an obligation under the Illinois Constitution to pay certain benefits if those benefits had included an expiration date under whichever negotiated agreement they were covered. The Illinois Constitution prohibits governments from doing anything that could cause retirement benefits for government workers to be \\\"diminished or impaired.\\\" In this particular case, the fact that the workers' agreements had expiration dates let the city of Chicago set an expiration date of 2013 for contribution to health benefits for workers who retired after 1989.\\n\\n\\n== Education ==\\n\\n\\n=== Schools and libraries ===\\nChicago Public Schools (CPS) is the governing body of the school district that contains over 600 public elementary and high schools citywide, including several selective-admission magnet schools. There are eleven selective enrollment high schools in the Chicago Public Schools, designed to meet the needs of Chicago's most academically advanced students. These schools offer a rigorous curriculum with mainly honors and Advanced Placement (AP) courses. Walter Payton College Prep High School is ranked number one in the city of Chicago and the state of Illinois.  Northside College Preparatory High School is ranked second, Jones College Prep is third, and the oldest magnet school in the city, Whitney M. Young Magnet High School, which was opened in 1975, is ranked fourth. The magnet school with the largest enrollment is Lane Technical College Prep High School. Lane is one of the oldest schools in Chicago and in 2012 was designated a National Blue Ribbon School by the U.S. Department of Education.Chicago high school rankings are determined by the average test scores on state achievement tests. The district, with an enrollment exceeding 400,545 students (2013-2014 20th Day Enrollment), is the third-largest in the U.S. On September 10, 2012, teachers for the Chicago Teachers Union went on strike for the first time since 1987 over pay, resources and other issues. According to data compiled in 2014, Chicago's \\\"choice system\\\", where students who test or apply and may attend one of a number of public high schools (there are about 130), sorts students of different achievement levels into different schools (high performing, middle performing, and low performing schools).Chicago has a network of Lutheran schools, and several private schools are run by other denominations and faiths, such as the Ida Crown Jewish Academy in West Ridge. Several private schools are completely secular, such as the Latin School of Chicago in the Near North Side neighborhood, the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools in Hyde Park, the British School of Chicago and the Francis W. Parker School in Lincoln Park, the Lycee Francais de Chicago in Uptown, the Feltre School in River North and the Morgan Park Academy. There are also the private Chicago Academy for the Arts, a high school focused on six different categories of the arts and the public Chicago High School for the Arts, a high school focused on five categories (visual arts, theatre, musical theatre, dance, and music) of the arts.The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Chicago operates Catholic schools, that include Jesuit preparatory schools and others including St. Rita of Cascia High School, De La Salle Institute, Josephinum Academy, DePaul College Prep, Cristo Rey Jesuit High School, Brother Rice High School, St. Ignatius College Preparatory School, Mount Carmel High School, Queen of Peace High School, Mother McAuley Liberal Arts High School, Marist High School, St. Patrick High School and Resurrection High School.\\nThe Chicago Public Library system operates 79 public libraries, including the central library, two regional libraries, and numerous branches distributed throughout the city.\\n\\n\\n=== Colleges and universities ===\\n\\nSince the 1850s, Chicago has been a world center of higher education and research with several universities. These institutions consistently rank among the top \\\"National Universities\\\" in the United States, as determined by U.S. News & World Report. Top universities in Chicago are: the University of Chicago; Illinois Institute of Technology; Northwestern University; Loyola University Chicago; DePaul University; Columbia College Chicago and University of Illinois at Chicago. Other notable schools include: Chicago State University; the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, the Illinois Institute of Art - Chicago; East-West University; National Louis University; North Park University; Northeastern Illinois University; Robert Morris University Illinois; Roosevelt University; Saint Xavier University; Rush University; and Shimer College.William Rainey Harper, the first president of the University of Chicago, was instrumental in the creation of the junior college concept, establishing nearby Joliet Junior College as the first in the nation in 1901. His legacy continues with the multiple community colleges in the Chicago proper, including the seven City Colleges of Chicago: Richard J. Daley College, Kennedy-King College, Malcolm X College, Olive-Harvey College, Truman College, Harold Washington College and Wilbur Wright College, in addition to the privately held MacCormac College.\\nChicago also has a high concentration of post-baccalaureate institutions, graduate schools, seminaries, and theological schools, such as the Adler School of Professional Psychology, The Chicago School of Professional Psychology, the Erikson Institute, The Institute for Clinical Social Work, the Lutheran School of Theology at Chicago, the Catholic Theological Union, the Moody Bible Institute, the John Marshall Law School and the University of Chicago Divinity School.\\n\\n\\n== Media ==\\n\\nThe Chicago metropolitan area is the third-largest media market in North America, after New York City and Los Angeles. Each of the big four U.S. television networks, CBS, ABC, NBC and Fox, directly owns and operates a high-definition television station in Chicago (WBBM 2, WLS 7, WMAQ 5 and WFLD 32, respectively). Former CW affiliate WGN-TV 9, which is owned by the Tribune Media, is carried with some programming differences, as \\\"WGN America\\\" on cable and satellite TV nationwide and in parts of the Caribbean. The city has also been the base of several talk shows, including, formerly, The Oprah Winfrey Show. Chicago Public Radio produces programs such as PRI's This American Life and NPR's Wait Wait...Don't Tell Me! The city also has two PBS member stations: WTTW 11, producer of shows such as Sneak Previews, The Frugal Gourmet, Lamb Chop's Play-Along and The McLaughlin Group, just to name a few, and WYCC 20 (permanently off-the-air as of November 2017).\\nTwo major daily newspapers are published in Chicago: the Chicago Tribune and the Chicago Sun-Times, with the Tribune having the larger circulation. There are also several regional and special-interest newspapers and magazines, such as Chicago, the Dziennik Zwiazkowy (Polish Daily News), Draugas (the Lithuanian daily newspaper), the Chicago Reader, the SouthtownStar, the Chicago Defender, the Daily Herald, Newcity, StreetWise and the Windy City Times. The entertainment and cultural magazine Time Out Chicago and GRAB magazine are also published in the city, as well as local music magazine Chicago Innerview. In addition, Chicago is the recent home of satirical national news outlet, The Onion, as well as its sister pop-culture publication, The A.V. Club.Since the 1980s, many motion pictures have been filmed and/or set in the city such as The Blues Brothers, The Matrix, Brewster's Millions, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Sixteen Candles, Home Alone, The Fugitive, I, Robot, Mean Girls, Wanted, Batman Begins, The Dark Knight,\\nDhoom 3, Transformers: Dark of the Moon, Transformers: Age of Extinction, Transformers: The Last Knight, Divergent, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,  Sinister 2, Suicide Squad, and Batman: Gotham by Gaslight.\\nChicago has also been the setting for many popular television shows, including the situation comedies Perfect Strangers and its spinoff Family Matters, Married... with Children, Punky Brewster, Kenan & Kel, Still Standing, The League, The Bob Newhart Show, and Shake It Up. The city served as the venue for the medical dramas ER and Chicago Hope, as well as the fantasy drama series Early Edition and the 2005-2009 drama Prison Break. Discovery Channel films two shows in Chicago: Cook County Jail and the Chicago version of Cash Cab. Chicago is currently the setting for CBS's The Good Wife and Mike and Molly, Showtime's Shameless, and NBC's Chicago Fire, Chicago P.D. and Chicago Med.Chicago has five 50,000 watt AM radio stations: the CBS Radio-owned WBBM and WSCR; the Tribune Broadcasting-owned WGN; the Cumulus Media-owned WLS; and the ESPN Radio-owned WMVP. Chicago is also home to a number of national radio shows, including Beyond the Beltway with Bruce DuMont on Sunday evenings.\\nChicago is also featured in a few video games, including Watch Dogs and Midtown Madness, a real-life, car-driving simulation game. In 2005, indie rock artist Sufjan Stevens created a concept album about Illinois titled Illinois; many of its songs were about Chicago and its history.\\n\\n\\n== Infrastructure ==\\n\\n\\n=== Transportation ===\\n\\nChicago is a major transportation hub in the United States. It is an important component in global distribution, as it is the third-largest inter-modal port in the world after Hong Kong and Singapore.The city of Chicago has a higher than average percentage of households without a car. In 2015, 26.5 percent of Chicago households were without a car, and increased slightly to 27.5 percent in 2016. The national average was 8.7 percent in 2016. Chicago averaged 1.12 cars per household in 2016, compared to a national average of 1.8.\\n\\n\\n==== Expressways ====\\n\\nSeven mainline and four auxiliary interstate highways (55, 57, 65 (only in Indiana), 80 (also in Indiana), 88, 90 (also in Indiana), 94 (also in Indiana), 190, 290, 294, and 355) run through Chicago and its suburbs. Segments that link to the city center are named after influential politicians, with three of them named after former U.S. Presidents (Eisenhower, Kennedy, and Reagan) and one named after two-time Democratic candidate Adlai Stevenson.\\nThe Kennedy and Dan Ryan Expressways are the busiest state maintained routes in the entire state of Illinois.\\n\\n\\n==== Transit systems ====\\n\\nThe Regional Transportation Authority (RTA) coordinates the operation of the three service boards: CTA, Metra, and Pace.\\n\\nThe Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) handles public transportation in the City of Chicago and a few adjacent suburbs outside of the Chicago city limits. The CTA operates an extensive network of buses and a rapid transit elevated and subway system known as the 'L' (for \\\"elevated\\\"), with lines designated by colors. These rapid transit lines also serve both Midway and O'Hare Airports. The CTA's rail lines consist of the Red, Blue, Green, Orange, Brown, Purple, Pink, and Yellow lines. Both the Red and Blue lines offer 24-hour service which makes Chicago one of a handful of cities around the world (and one of two in the United States, the other being New York City) to offer rail service 24 hours a day, every day of the year, within the city's limits.\\nMetra, the nation's second-most used passenger regional rail network, operates an 11-line commuter rail service in Chicago and throughout the Chicago suburbs. The Metra Electric Line shares its trackage with Northern Indiana Commuter Transportation District's South Shore Line, which provides commuter service between South Bend and Chicago.\\nPace provides bus and paratransit service in over 200 surrounding suburbs with some extensions into the city as well. A 2005 study found that one quarter of commuters used public transit.Greyhound Lines provides inter-city bus service to and from the city, and Chicago is also the hub for the Midwest network of Megabus (North America).\\n\\n\\n==== Passenger rail ====\\n\\nAmtrak long distance and commuter rail services originate from Union Station. Chicago is one of the largest hubs of passenger rail service in the nation. The services terminate in San Francisco, Washington, D.C., New York City, Indianapolis, New Orleans, Portland, Seattle, Milwaukee, Quincy, St. Louis, Carbondale, Boston, Grand Rapids, Port Huron, Pontiac, Los Angeles, and San Antonio. An attempt was made in the early 20th century to link Chicago with New York City via the Chicago - New York Electric Air Line Railroad. Parts of this were built, but it was never completed.\\n\\n\\n==== Bicycle-sharing system ====\\nChicago's Department of Transportation oversees operation of Divvy, North America's largest bicycle-sharing system (by geography), allowing residents and visitors the ability to check out public bikes from any of hundreds of automated stations located over a large area of the city, take them for short rides, and return them to any station of their choosing.  Divvy was initially launched in 2013 with 750 bikes and 75 docking stations and has since expanded to 5,800 bikes and 580 stations as of December 2016.\\n\\n\\n==== Freight rail ====\\nChicago is the largest hub in the railroad industry. Six of the seven Class I railroads meet in Chicago, with the exception being the Kansas City Southern Railway. As of  2002, severe freight train congestion caused trains to take as long to get through the Chicago region as it took to get there from the West Coast of the country (about 2 days). According to U.S. Department of Transportation, the volume of imported and exported goods transported via rail to, from, or through Chicago is forecast to increase nearly 150 percent between 2010 and 2040. CREATE, the Chicago Region Environmental and Transportation Efficiency Program, comprises about 70 programs, including crossovers, overpasses and underpasses, that intend to significantly improve the speed of freight movements in the Chicago area.\\n\\n\\n==== Airports ====\\n\\nChicago is served by O'Hare International Airport, the world's second-busiest airport measured by airline operations, on the far Northwest Side, and Midway International Airport on the Southwest Side. In 2005, O'Hare was the world's busiest airport by aircraft movements and the second-busiest by total passenger traffic. Both O'Hare and Midway are owned and operated by the City of Chicago. Gary/Chicago International Airport and Chicago Rockford International Airport, located in Gary, Indiana and Rockford, Illinois, respectively, can serve as alternate Chicago area airports, however they do not offer as many commercial flights as O'Hare and Midway. In recent years the state of Illinois has been leaning towards building an entirely new airport in the Illinois suburbs of Chicago. The City of Chicago is the world headquarters for United Airlines, the world's third-largest airline.\\n\\n\\n==== Port authority ====\\n\\nThe Port of Chicago consists of several major port facilities within the city of Chicago operated by the Illinois International Port District (formerly known as the Chicago Regional Port District). The central element of the Port District, Calumet Harbor, is maintained by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.\\nIroquois Landing Lakefront Terminal: at the mouth of the Calumet River, it includes 100 acres (0.40 km2) of warehouses and facilities on Lake Michigan with over 780,000 square meters (8,400,000 square feet) of storage.\\nLake Calumet terminal: located at the union of the Grand Calumet River and Little Calumet River 6 miles (9.7 km) inland from Lake Michigan. Includes three transit sheds totaling over 29,000 square meters (310,000 square feet) adjacent to over 900 linear meters (3,000 linear feet) of ship and barge berthing.\\nGrain (14 million bushels) and bulk liquid (800,000 barrels) storage facilities along Lake Calumet.\\nThe Illinois International Port district also operates Foreign trade zone No. 22, which extends 60 miles (97 km) from Chicago's city limits.\\n\\n\\n=== Utilities ===\\nElectricity for most of northern Illinois is provided by Commonwealth Edison, also known as ComEd. Their service territory borders Iroquois County to the south, the Wisconsin border to the north, the Iowa border to the west and the Indiana border to the east. In northern Illinois, ComEd (a division of Exelon) operates the greatest number of nuclear generating plants in any US state. Because of this, ComEd reports indicate that Chicago receives about 75% of its electricity from nuclear power. Recently, the city began installing wind turbines on government buildings to promote renewable energy.Natural gas is provided by Peoples Gas, a subsidiary of Integrys Energy Group, which is headquartered in Chicago.\\nDomestic and industrial waste was once incinerated but it is now landfilled, mainly in the Calumet area. From 1995 to 2008, the city had a blue bag program to divert recyclable refuse from landfills. Because of low participation in the blue bag programs, the city began a pilot program for blue bin recycling like other cities. This proved successful and blue bins were rolled out across the city.\\n\\n\\n=== Health systems ===\\n\\nThe Illinois Medical District is on the Near West Side. It includes Rush University Medical Center, ranked as the second best hospital in the Chicago metropolitan area by U.S. News & World Report for 2014-16, the University of Illinois Medical Center at Chicago, Jesse Brown VA Hospital, and John H. Stroger Jr. Hospital of Cook County, one of the busiest trauma centers in the nation.Two of the country's premier academic medical centers reside in Chicago, including Northwestern Memorial Hospital and the University of Chicago Medical Center. The Chicago campus of Northwestern University includes the Feinberg School of Medicine; Northwestern Memorial Hospital, which is ranked as the best hospital in the Chicago metropolitan area by U.S. News & World Report for 2010-11; the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago, which is ranked the best U.S. rehabilitation hospital by U.S. News & World Report; the new Prentice Women's Hospital; and Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago.\\nThe University of Illinois College of Medicine at UIC is the second largest medical school in the United States (2,600 students including those at campuses in Peoria, Rockford and Urbana-Champaign).In addition, the Chicago Medical School and Loyola University Chicago's Stritch School of Medicine are located in the suburbs of North Chicago and Maywood, respectively. The Midwestern University Chicago College of Osteopathic Medicine is in Downers Grove.\\nThe American Medical Association, Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education, Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education, American Osteopathic Association, American Dental Association, Academy of General Dentistry, Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, American Association of Nurse Anesthetists, American College of Surgeons, American Society for Clinical Pathology, American College of Healthcare Executives, the American Hospital Association and Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association are all based in Chicago.\\n\\n\\n== Sister cities ==\\n\\nChicago has 28 sister cities around the world. Like Chicago, many of them are or were the second-most populous city or second-most influential city of their country, or they are the main city of a country that has had large amounts of immigrants settle in Chicago. These relationships have sought to promote economic, cultural, educational, and other ties.To celebrate the sister cities, Chicago hosts a yearly festival in Daley Plaza, which features cultural acts and food tastings from the other cities. In addition, the Chicago Sister Cities program hosts a number of delegation and formal exchanges. In some cases, these exchanges have led to further informal collaborations, such as the academic relationship between the Buehler Center on Aging, Health & Society at the Feinberg School of Medicine of Northwestern University and the Institute of Gerontology of Ukraine (originally of the Soviet Union), that was originally established as part of the Chicago-Kiev sister cities program.Sister cities\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\n\\nChicago Wilderness\\nGentrification of Chicago\\nList of cities with the most skyscrapers\\nList of people from Chicago\\nList of fiction set in Chicago\\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Central Chicago\\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in North Side Chicago\\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in South Side Chicago\\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in West Side Chicago\\n\\n\\n== Notes ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== Bibliography ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\n\\nOfficial website (Website archives at the Wayback Machine (archive index))\\nChoose Chicago official tourism website\\nChicago at Curlie (based on DMOZ)\\nMaps of Chicago from the American Geographical Society Library\\nHistoric American Landscapes Survey (HALS) No. IL-10, \\\"Chicago Cityscape, Chicago, Cook County, IL\\\", 45 photos, 4 photo caption pages\\nChicago - LocalWiki Local Chicago Wiki\", \"rev_id\": 857576354, \"accessed\": \"2018-09-03 00:23:59.864295\", \"links\": [\"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\", \"Greyhound Lines\", \"Women's National Basketball Association\", \"American Hospital Association\", \"Japan\", \"Washington, D.C.\", \"Guaranteed Rate Field\", \"U.S. Army Corps of Engineers\", \"Shake It Up (U.S. TV series)\", \"WMVP\", \"African American\", \"WBBM (AM)\", \"Chicago Mercantile Exchange\", \"Rick Tramonto\", \"Great Chicago Fire\", \"West Loop\", \"Divvy\", \"Allstate Arena\", \"Lutheran school\", \"France\", \"NBA\", \"Sears\", \"Peggy Notebaert Nature Museum\", \"WFLD\", \"Great Lakes Megalopolis\", \"Art\", \"Illinois Medical District\", \"Amtrak\", \"National Football League\", \"Eternal Silence (sculpture)\", \"Super Bowl XX\", \"Missouri Valley Conference\", \"Industrial district\", \"Chicago\", \"Metaxa\", \"United States House of Representatives\", \"Stanley Cup\", \"MacCormac College\", \"Gwendolyn Brooks\", \"American College of Surgeons\", \"Chopin Park (Chicago)\", \"Swedes\", \"Southern United States\", \"ThyssenKrupp\", \"Jews\", \"Lincoln Park\", \"South Shore Line (NICTD)\", \"WSCR\", \"Seattle\", \"Monument with Standing Beast\", \"Dan Ryan Expressway\", \"American Medical Association\", \"Soldier Field\", \"Poles\", \"The CW\", \"Chicago soul\", \"Sporting News\", \"Chase Tower (Chicago)\", \"Jean Baptiste Point du Sable\", \"Bill Swerski's Superfans\", \"Chicago (disambiguation)\", \"Rush University Medical Center\", \"Christopher Columbus (Grant Park)\", \"Magnificent Mile\", \"Cook County Forest Preserves\", \"Stephen Douglas\", \"Allium tricoccum\", \"DePaul College Prep\", \"Ford Motor Company\", \"Ace Hardware\", \"Gentrification of Chicago\", \"Rochester, New York\", \"Mies van der Rohe\", \"Prairie\", \"Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics\", \"DuSable Museum of African American History\", \"American Association of Nurse Anesthetists\", \"Green Bay Packers\", \"The Love Song of J.

He is the only son to father Calvin Edward Cooksey, and mother Katonya Breaux, and was given the birth name Christopher Edwin Breaux. When he was five years old, Ocean and his family relocated to New Orleans, Louisiana.Ocean was first introduced to music through his mother, who would often play recordings by jazz musicians on her car stereo, which included albums by Celine Dion and Anita Baker, as well as the soundtrack to The Phantom of the Opera musical. Ocean also frequented the town's local jazz bars and parlors, which encouraged him to begin recording his own music. In order to raise funds to rent recording studios, Ocean performed several jobs as a teenager, which he described as \\\"numerous hustles\\\", as he would wash cars, mow lawns, and walk dogs for his neighbors. Ocean later enrolled in the University of New Orleans to study music, and moved into its dormitory in 2005. Shortly after he enrolled in the university, the effects of Hurricane Katrina forced Ocean to transfer to the University of Louisiana at Lafayette.\\n\\n\\n== Career ==\\n\\n\\n=== 2005-11: Odd Future and Nostalgia Ultra ===\\nAfter Hurricane Katrina hit Ocean's hometown of New Orleans, it destroyed his home, and his personal recording facility was destroyed by floodwater and looting. To continue recording music, he moved to Los Angeles and intended to stay for just six weeks but decided to stay longer and develop his music career after establishing contact with people in the music industry. He recorded some demos at a friend's studio and shopped them around Los Angeles.\\nAfter getting a songwriting deal, he started working with other record producers and wrote songs for Justin Bieber, John Legend, Brandy, and Beyonce.\\nOcean later said of his work at the time, \\\"There was a point where I was composing for other people, and it might have been comfy to continue to do that and enjoy that income stream and the anonymity. But that's not why I moved away from school and away from family.\\\"\\nOcean joined Los Angeles-based hip hop collective Odd Future, whom he had met in 2009. His friendship with Odd Future member Tyler, The Creator reinvigorated Ocean's songwriting. In late 2009, he met Tricky Stewart, who helped him sign a writing contract with Def Jam Recordings.On February 18, 2011, Ocean released his first mixtape, Nostalgia, Ultra, to critical acclaim. The mixtape focuses on interpersonal relationships, personal reflection and social commentary. NPR's Andrew Noz said Ocean's songwriting is \\\"smart and subtle...setting him apart from the pack.\\\" Rolling Stone magazine's Jonah Weiner wrote that Ocean was a \\\"gifted avant-R&B smoothie\\\".\\nIn April 2011, Ocean stated that his relationship with Def Jam strengthened since the release of the mixtape. The mixtape made Ocean widely known and led to his collaborations with rappers Jay Z and Kanye West.\\nOcean first appeared in Tyler, The Creator's music video for the single \\\"She\\\", from Tyler's debut studio album Goblin (2011). His first performance was in collaboration with Odd Future at the 2011 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, where he later joined them for their first tour across the east coast of the United States. On May 19, 2011 Ocean's record label Def Jam announced its plans to re-release Nostalgia, Ultra as an EP. The single 'Novacane' was released to iTunes in May 2011, and the EP originally was set to be released the next month, but was delayed.In June 2011, Ocean revealed that he would work on the upcoming Kanye West and Jay-Z collaborative album, Watch the Throne. Ocean co-wrote and featured on two tracks: \\\"No Church in the Wild\\\" and \\\"Made in America\\\".\\nOn July 28, 2011, a song titled \\\"Thinkin Bout You\\\", leaked on the internet. It was later revealed the song was a reference track, written by Ocean, for Roc Nation artist Bridget Kelly's debut studio album. Kelly renamed the song 'Thinking About Forever'. In September 2011, a music video directed by High5Collective for Ocean's version was released, yet the song still appeared on Kelly's debut EP Every Girl. In August 2011, Frank Ocean made his first appearance on the cover of the publication The FADER, in its 75th issue.\\n\\n\\n=== 2012-13: Channel Orange ===\\nOcean released the cover art for his debut studio album's lead single, titled \\\"Thinkin Bout You\\\", revealing the song would be released to digital retailers on April 10, 2012. However, a month earlier, a re-mastered version of the song had already leaked. About the prospective single he said: \\\"It succinctly defines me as an artist for where I am right now and that was the aim,\\\" he said of the follow-up to his acclaimed Nostalgia, Ultra. \\\"It's about the stories. If I write 14 stories that I love, then the next step is to get the environment of music around it to best envelop the story and all kinds of sonic goodness.\\\"\\n\\nIn 2012, Ocean released his debut studio album Channel Orange to universal acclaim from critics, who later named it the best album of the year in the HMV's Poll of Polls. It also earned Ocean six Grammy Award nominations and was credited by some writers for moving the R&B genre in a different, more challenging direction. Considered as Ocean's first commercial release on a traditional record label, Channel Orange featured unconventional songs that were noted for their storytelling and social commentary, and a dense musical fusion that drew on hip hop, soul, and R&B. Funk and electric music also influenced his album. The songs about unrequited love in particular received the most attention, partly because of Ocean's announcement prior to the album's release, when he revealed that his first love was a man. The announcement made global headlines, and some critics compared its cultural impact to when David Bowie revealed that he was bisexual in 1972.\\n\\nChannel Orange debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 and sold 131,000 copies in its first week. The majority of its first-week sales were digital copies from iTunes, while approximately 3,000 of the sales were physical copies.  On January 30, Channel Orange was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). By September 2014, it had sold 621,000 copies, according to Nielsen SoundScan. Ocean promoted the album with his 2012 Summer Tour, which featured final appearances at the Coachella and Lollapalooza festivals.On May 28, 2013, Ocean announced the You're Not Dead... 2013 Tour; a fourteen-date European and Canadian tour that began on June 16, 2013, in Munich. He had been scheduled to perform at the first night of OVO Fest on August 4, 2013; however he was forced to cancel his appearance due to a small vocal cord injury. The first night of the music festival was subsequently cancelled and James Blake was booked to appear during the second night as Ocean's replacement. Ocean appeared on John Mayer's album Paradise Valley, as a featured artist on a song called \\\"Wildfire\\\".\\n\\n\\n=== 2014-16: Endless and Blonde ===\\nIn February 2013, Ocean confirmed that he had started work on his second studio album, which he confirmed would be another concept album. He revealed that he was working with Tyler, the Creator, Pharrell Williams, and Danger Mouse on the record. He later stated that he was being influenced by The Beach Boys and The Beatles. He stated he was interested in collaborating with Tame Impala and King Krule and that he would record part of the album in Bora Bora.On March 10, 2014, the song \\\"Hero\\\" was made available for free download on SoundCloud. The song is a collaboration with Mick Jones, Paul Simonon and Diplo and is a part of Converse's Three Artists. One Song series.In April 2014, Ocean stated that his second album was nearly finished. In June, Billboard reported that the singer was working with a string of artists such as Happy Perez (whom he worked with on nostalgia, ULTRA), Charlie Gambetta and Kevin Ristro, while producers Hit-Boy, Rodney Jerkins and Danger Mouse were also said to be on board. On November 29, 2014, Ocean released a snippet of a new song supposedly from his upcoming follow-up to channel ORANGE called \\\"Memrise\\\" on his official Tumblr page. The Guardian described the song as: \\\"...a song which affirms that despite reportedly changing labels and management, he has maintained both his experimentation and sense of melancholy in the intervening years\\\". On April 6, 2015, Ocean announced that his follow-up to channel ORANGE would be released in July with \\\"two versions\\\", as well as a publication, although no further details were released. The album was ultimately not released in July, with no explanation given for its delay. The publication was rumoured to be called Boys Don't Cry, and the album was slated to feature the aforementioned \\\"Memrise\\\". In February 2016, Ocean was featured on Kanye West's album The Life of Pablo on the track \\\"Wolves\\\" along with Vic Mensa and Sia Furler. A month later, the song was re-edited by West, and Ocean's part was separated and listed on the track list as its own song titled \\\"Frank's Track.\\\"In July 2016, he hinted at a possible second album with an image on his website pointing to a July release date. The image shows a library card labeled Boys Don't Cry with numerous stamps, implying various due dates. The dates begin with July 2, 2015 and conclude with July 2016. Ocean's brother, Ryan Breaux, further suggested this release with an Instagram caption of the same library card photo reading BOYS DON'T CRY #JULY2016.By August 1, 2016, at approximately 3 AM, an endless live stream shot in negative lighting in what is allegedly a Brooklyn warehouse, sponsored by Apple Music began to surface on boysdontcry.co which appeared to show Ocean woodworking and sporadically playing instrumentals on loop. It later became clear that these instrumentals were from his upcoming visual album Endless; the full version is estimated to be 140 hours long. That same day, many news outlets reported that August 5, 2016 could be the release date for Boys Don't Cry. That date also turned out to be inaccurate, though in a Reddit AMA session, his collaborator Malay said that Ocean is a perfectionist, constantly tweaking things, and that his art cannot be rushed.On August 18 and 19, 2016, the live stream was accompanied with music and at midnight an Apple Music link was directed to a project called Endless. Endless would be Ocean's last album with Def Jam Recordings to fulfill his contract with the record label. Before the visual album's release on Apple Music, Ocean had already begun making efforts to part ways with Def Jam, who signed the artist in 2009. He describes his negotiations with the label as a \\\"seven-year chess game\\\", while adding that he had replaced many of his representatives (including his lawyer and manager) during the process, as well as having to buy back all of his master recordings that previously belonged to Def Jam.At midnight Pacific time on August 20, 2016, a music video for a song titled \\\"Nikes\\\" was uploaded to Ocean's Connect page on Apple Music and later to his own website. Also on August 20, Ocean announced pop-up shops in Los Angeles, New York City, Chicago, and London for his magazine Boys Don't Cry, and released his second studio album Blonde to widespread acclaim. Blonde debuted at number one in several countries, including the United States and the United Kingdom, and recorded sales of 232,000 copies (275,000 with album-equivalent units) in its first week. Rather than going on a typical promotional tour playing radio festivals and appearing on television shows, Ocean spent a month after the release of Blonde, traveling to countries such as China, Japan and France. He also chose not to submit Blonde for consideration at the Grammy Awards, stating \\\"that institution certainly has nostalgic importance; it just doesn't seem to be representing very well for people who come from where I come from, and hold down what I hold down.\\\" Time ranked it as the best album of 2016 on its year-end list. Forbes estimated that Blonde earned Ocean nearly one million in profits after one week of availability, attributing this to him releasing the album independently and as a limited exclusive release on iTunes and Apple Music.\\n\\n\\n=== 2017-present: Blonded Radio and singles ===\\n\\nOn February 21, 2017, Scottish DJ and producer Calvin Harris announced the song \\\"Slide\\\", a collaboration between Harris, Ocean and Migos, from Harris' fifth studio album Funk Wav Bounces Vol. 1. Ocean is credited with featured vocals and songwriting, while production is handled by Harris. The song was released on February 24, 2017 and featured on the first episode of Ocean's Beats 1 radio show, Blonded Radio. It is also Ocean's first recorded collaboration since leaving Def Jam, with Ocean being listed in the liner notes as \\\"appear[ing] courtesy of Frank Ocean\\\". The song went on to be certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America and became Ocean's first top ten single on the Billboard Mainstream Top 40 chart, peaking at #9. On March 10, 2017, Ocean released a new single \\\"Chanel\\\" on the second episode of Blonded Radio, as well as playing an alternate version featuring American rapper ASAP Rocky. The song was his first solo effort to be released after Blonde and Endless in 2016. On subsequent episodes of Blonded Radio in April, Ocean premiered \\\"Biking\\\" featuring Jay-Z and Tyler the Creator, \\\"Lens\\\", as well as an alternate version featuring Travis Scott, and a remix of Endless track \\\"Slide On Me\\\" featuring Young Thug. On May 15 Ocean was featured on ASAP Mob's \\\"RAF\\\", premiered on Blonded alongside a solo version of \\\"Biking\\\". On August 28, Ocean released another single, \\\"Provider\\\", on Blonded Radio.\\nIn October 2017, Ocean published a photo essay titled \\\"New 17\\\" to British magazine i-D. In the essay, Ocean said \\\"If you liked two thousand and seventeen then you'll love two thousand and eighteen\\\". In November 2017, Ocean hinted via Tumblr that his fifth project was complete.On February 14, 2018, Ocean released \\\"Moon River\\\", a cover of the song performed by Audrey Hepburn in the 1961 film, Breakfast at Tiffany's. In May 2018, Ocean was featured on the tracks \\\"Brotha Man\\\" and \\\"Purity\\\" from ASAP Rocky's third studio album Testing. In August 2018, Ocean provided an uncredited appearance on the song \\\"Carousel\\\" on Travis Scott's album Astroworld.\\n\\n\\n== Artistry ==\\nOcean's music has been characterized by music writers as idiosyncratic in style. Ocean's music generally includes the electronic keyboard, often performed by Ocean himself, and is backed by a subdued rhythm section in the production. His compositions are often midtempo, feature unconventional melodies, and they occasionally have an experimental song structure. He has been characterised as both an \\\"avant-garde R&B artist\\\" and a \\\"pop musician\\\". In his songwriting, Jon Pareles of The New York Times observes \\\"open echoes of self-guided, innovative R&B songwriters like Prince, Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye, Maxwell, Erykah Badu and particularly R. Kelly and his way of writing melodies that hover between speech and song, asymmetrical and syncopated.\\\" While nostalgia, ULTRA featured both original music by Ocean and tracks relying on sampled melodies, channel ORANGE showcased Ocean as the primary musical composer, of which music journalist Robert Christgau opines, \\\"when he's the sole composer Ocean resists making a show of himself--resists the dope hook, the smart tempo, the transcendent falsetto itself.\\\"\\n\\nOcean's lyrics deal with themes of love, longing, misgiving, and nostalgia. His debut single \\\"Novacane\\\" juxtaposes the numbness and artificiality of a sexual relationship with that of mainstream radio, while \\\"Voodoo\\\" merges themes of spirituality and sexuality, and is an eccentric take on such subject matter common in R&B. The latter song was released by Ocean on his Tumblr account and references both the traditional spiritual \\\"He's Got the Whole World in His Hands\\\" and the female anatomy in its chorus: \\\"she's got the whole wide world in her juicy fruit / he's got the whole wide world in his pants / he wrapped the whole wide world in a wedding band / then put the whole wide world on her hands / she's got the whole wide world in her hands / he's got the whole wide world in his hands.\\\" Certain songs on channel ORANGE allude to Ocean's experience with unrequited love. Culture critic Nelson George asserts that, along with Miguel, Ocean has \\\"staked out ground where [he is] not competing with those hit-driven [commercial R&B] acts\\\" and is \\\"cultivating a sound that balances adult concerns with a sense of young men trying to understand their own desires (an apt description of Ocean, particularly).\\\"Ocean describes himself as \\\"a baritone, with tenor moments.\\\" Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone calls him a torch singer due to \\\"his feel for romantic tragedy, unfurling in slow-boiling ballads\\\". Ocean's stage presence during live shows has been described by Chris Richards of the Washington Post as \\\"low-key\\\".\\n\\n\\n=== Photography ===\\nOn August 20, 2016, Ocean released a 360-page magazine, Boys Don't Cry, alongside with his long-awaited second album Blonde. The fashion and automobile-themed publication contains the photoprojects from Wolfgang Tillmans, Viviane Sassen, Tyrone Lebon, Harley Weir, Michael Mayren and Ocean himself. Four months later, British magazine Print published another photowork from Frank Ocean.On May 1, 2017, Ocean attended annual Met Gala as a special photographer for Vogue. On October 23, 2017, he made two covers and a visual essay for British fashion magazine, i-D.\\n\\n\\n== Personal life ==\\nIn a 2011 interview, Ocean stated that he had attempted to change his name to Christopher Francis Ocean through a legal website on his 2010 birthday. The change was reportedly partly inspired by the 1960 film Ocean's 11. In March 2014 it was again reported that Breaux was legally changing his name, simply to Frank Ocean. In November 2014, it was revealed that the name change had not been legalized, due to multiple speeding offenses. On April 23, 2015, Ocean successfully changed his legal name to Frank Ocean, however he has still been credited as Cristopher Breaux in the liner notes of some releases.Ocean wrote an open letter, initially intended for the liner notes on Channel Orange, that preemptively addressed speculation about his attraction in the past to another man. Instead, on July 4, 2012, he published an open letter on his Tumblr blog recounting unrequited feelings he had for another young man when he was 19 years old, citing it as his first true love. He used the blog to thank the man for his influence, and also thanked his mother and other friends, saying \\\"I don't know what happens now, and that's alright. I don't have any secrets I need kept anymore...I feel like a free man.\\\" Numerous celebrities publicly voiced their support for Ocean following his announcement, including Beyonce and Jay Z. Members of the hip hop industry generally responded positively to the announcement. Tyler, the Creator also tweeted his support for Ocean, along with other members of OFWGKTA. Russell Simmons, a business magnate in the hip hop industry, wrote a congratulatory article in Global Grind saying \\\"Today is a big day for hip-hop. It is a day that will define who we really are. How compassionate will we be? How loving can we be? How inclusive are we? [...] Your decision to go public about your sexual orientation gives hope and light to so many young people still living in fear.\\\"Ocean appears in a 2013 video game Grand Theft Auto V as himself playing the host of an in-game radio station called blonded Los Santos 97.8 FM. He also lends the songs \\\"Provider\\\", \\\"Ivy\\\", \\\"Crack Rock, \\\"Chanel\\\", \\\"Nights\\\" and \\\"Pretty Sweet\\\", and sings station jingles.\\nIn June 2016, following the Orlando gay nightclub shooting that killed 49 people, Ocean published an essay expressing his sadness and frustration regarding the event. He mentions his first experience with transphobia was with his father when he was six years old and how many people pass on their hateful ideals to the next generation which sends thousands of people down the path of suicidal tendencies. In 2017, Ocean's father Calvin Cooksey sued him for $14.5 million over the homophobia claim. On 17 October 2017, and after a day-long hearing that saw Ocean, father Calvin Cooksey, and mother Katonya Breaux taking the stand, the residing U.S. District judge ruled that Cooksey hadn't provided sufficient evidence of defamation and ruled in favor of the singer.\\n\\n\\n== Legal issues ==\\nOcean sampled the music from the Eagles' song \\\"Hotel California\\\" on the song \\\"American Wedding\\\" from Nostalgia, Ultra. When asked about it, Ocean stated that Eagles band member \\\"Don Henley is apparently intimidated by my rendition of 'Hotel California'. He threatened to sue if I perform it again.\\\"\\nIn response to Ocean's comments, the Eagles' legal representative released a statement: \\\"Frank Ocean did not merely 'sample' a portion of the Eagles' 'Hotel California,' he took the whole master track, plus the song's existing melody, and replaced the lyrics with his own. This is not creative, let alone 'intimidating.' It's illegal. For the record, Don Henley has not threatened or instituted any legal action against Frank Ocean, although the Eagles are now considering whether they should.\\\" Chris Richards of The Washington Post remarked that \\\"certain boomers don't like [Ocean] as much\\\" as \\\"information-age babies\\\" due to the controversy.On December 31, 2012, Ocean was pulled over in Mono County, California for speeding. In a search police officers found a few grams of marijuana. He was cited for possession, driving on a suspended license and having tinted windows. In January 2013, Ocean got into an altercation with Chris Brown over a parking space, outside a recording studio in West Hollywood. Police officers in Los Angeles said Brown was under investigation, describing the incident as \\\"battery\\\" due to Brown punching Ocean.\\nOcean said he would not press charges despite the fact that Brown had threatened to shoot him, and one of Brown's entourage had called him a homophobic slur. Ocean criticized Brown in the song \\\"Sunday\\\", from Earl Sweatshirt's album Doris. In the song, Frank Ocean refers to this incident with the lyrics \\\"And why's his mug all bloody, that was a three on one\\\".\\nOn March 7, 2014, Chipotle Mexican Grill sued Ocean to receive the money back they paid him in advance for a commercial that Ocean backed out of due to Ocean having a problem with the material in the advertisement. The advertisement was to feature Ocean singing the song \\\"Pure Imagination\\\", and was to promote sustainable farming. Ocean backed out of the spot when Chipotle refused to remove their logo and name from the advertisement. The lawsuit was dropped on March 20 after Ocean paid the advance back in full. The commercial, titled The Scarecrow, was ultimately released with Fiona Apple performing the song.On October 17, 2017, Frank Ocean's father, Calvin Cooksey, sued Ocean on charges of defamation and other damages with restitution payments reaching up to $14.5 million. The issue started when Frank Ocean wrote a post in his personal Tumblr responding to the Pulse nightclub shooting back in June 2016 and told a story about how he heard his father use a transphobic slur towards a waitress when he was a kid. The post stated that: \\\"I was six years old when I heard my dad call our transgender waitress a faggot as he dragged me out a neighborhood diner saying we wouldn't be served because she was dirty. That was the last afternoon I saw my father and the first time I heard that word, I think, although it wouldn't shock me if it wasn't. Many hate us and wish we didn't exist.\\\" The judge ended up ruling in favor of Frank Ocean and the case was put to an end.On February 20, 2018, Ocean sued record producer and long-time collaborator Om'Mas Keith, alleging that Keith was claiming songwriting credits on several songs he did not contribute to writing. Ocean stated that Keith was hired as a producer and paid a flat fee for his contributions, with his legal complaint stating that Keith wrongfully claimed writing credits on the Blonde tracks \\\"Nikes\\\", \\\"Ivy\\\", \\\"Pink + White\\\", \\\"Be Yourself\\\", \\\"Solo\\\", \\\"Skyline To\\\", \\\"Nights\\\", \\\"Pretty Sweet\\\", \\\"White Ferrari\\\", \\\"Godspeed\\\" and \\\"Futura Free\\\" through the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers. On May 30, Keith countersued Ocean, claiming to have written all songs listed in Ocean's suit as well as \\\"Facebook Story\\\" and \\\"Seigfried\\\" from Blonde, and \\\"Florida\\\" and \\\"At Your Best (You Are Love)\\\" from Endless, the latter of which was originally written and recorded by the Isley Brothers in 1975. Keith also claimed that the flat-fee had been agreed upon for Channel Orange, and that he told Ocean he would not accept the same terms again. His countersuit demanded that Ocean's lawsuit would be thrown out, as well as unspecified damages and a court order stating that he co-wrote all songs in question, accounting for all profits Ocean received for the tracks.\\n\\n\\n== Discography ==\\n\\nStudio albums\\n\\nChannel Orange (2012)\\nBlonde (2016)\\n\\n\\n== Awards and nominations ==\\n\\n\\n== Notes ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== Further reading ==\\nHimmelman, Jeff (February 7, 2013). \\\"Frank Ocean Can Fly\\\".

On February 10, 2011, Tyler released the music video for the first single, \\\"Yonkers\\\", from the album. An extended version with an extra verse was later released on iTunes four days later, along with an extended version of the previously released track \\\"Sandwitches\\\". On February 16, Tyler and Hodgy performed \\\"Sandwitches\\\" on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon, making it the first television appearance for any Odd Future member.One month later, on March 16, 2011, Tyler and Hodgy performed the tracks \\\"Yonkers\\\" and \\\"Sandwitches\\\" on the mtvU Woodie Awards with the rest of Odd Future. On that same day, a preview of \\\"Tron Cat\\\" was released online as promotion for the album.\\nAlso in March, the album cover was posted online featuring a colored picture of Buffalo Bill when he was 19, and it was featured as a backdrop for Tyler's MTV performance. On March 24, Tyler posted the track list on his Twitter, and the track \\\"Sandwitches\\\" was to be included on the album.Goblin was also released as a deluxe edition with alternate artwork and packaging, a poster, lyrics, and a second disc containing three bonus tracks. Tyler released the deluxe edition cover of the album on his Flickr on April 4, 2011.On April 21, Tyler posted several pictures from the filming of a new music video, followed by an announcement that the video is finished on the next day. On April 22, Tyler released a promo video involving himself portraying a character named Thurnis Haley who is a golfer. On April 28, \\\"Tron Cat\\\" was leaked online. On May 3, Tyler and Hodgy performed \\\"Sandwitches\\\" and \\\"Analog\\\" on BBC, along with them performing \\\"65\\\" off of the upcoming MellowHype album.The third single to be released from the album was \\\"She\\\" featuring Frank Ocean. The music video for \\\"She\\\" was released June 3, 2011.\\n\\n\\n== Critical reception ==\\nGoblin received generally positive reviews from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 72, based on 37 reviews. Jon Dolan from Rolling Stone complimenting the album's \\\"lush, left-field R&B-tinged tracks\\\" along with its \\\"early-Eminem evil\\\" lyrics. David Jeffries of AllMusic commenting that \\\"Tyler's production is as attractive as ever, contrasting his disgusting rhymes and gruff voice with subdued, sometimes serene beats that echo and creep.\\\" Brad Wete of Entertainment Weekly said, \\\"Too bad Kanye--who's also a fan--already used the title last fall, because Goblin is one Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy.\\\" Slant Magazine critic Huw Jones praising its production and stating that \\\"Goblin could well be one of the decade's most significant releases...a masterpiece for those capable of stomaching it.\\\" The reviewer Jen Long from the BBC enjoyed Tyler's lyrical \\\"run of shock tactics reminiscent of Eminem\\\", many strongly criticized the similarity. Joshua Errett of Now said that someone should have informed Tyler that \\\"Eminem already did this 15 years ago.\\\" Louis Pattison of NME said, \\\"It's an album that leaves you in no doubt that Odd Future's leader is a rare talent.\\\"Evan Rytlewski of The A.V. Club said, \\\"Brash and unwieldy as it seems on the surface, Goblin is a deliberately created work of art, one of the densest and most provocative statements that independent rap has produced in years.\\\" Scott Plagenhoef of Pitchfork said, \\\"His fantasies and lack of filter are still huge roadblocks for many if not most listeners. They're depraved and despicable, tied in part to a long and unfortunate legacy of gangster and street rap. They're also one aspect of a larger, character-driven story--a license that we grant to visual arts, film, and literature but rarely to pop music.\\\" Max Feldman of PopMatters said, \\\"It's that sort of shameful thing that would prevent us from seeing Goblin for what it really is: a massive spoonful of marvelous hip-hop medicine, of the most unnerving, hyperreal humour you may well ever hear.\\\" Chris Martins of Spin said, \\\"Is the entire thing about 20 minutes too long? Probably. But the obvious lack of outside meddling proves that Tyler's auteur status remains intact. He is, in the parlance of our times, still swaggin'. Now maybe he can get to work on winning that Grammy.\\\" Randal Roberts from the Los Angeles Times commented that the album just \\\"presses the same button that Elvis, Johnny Rotten, Chuck D and Eminem did\\\" and after \\\"about 50 minutes you just want Tyler, the Creator to shut the hell up.\\\"\\n\\n\\n== Commercial performance ==\\nGoblin debuted at number five on the US Billboard 200, with first-week sales of 45,000 copies in the United States.

Although praised for its influence, Instagram has been the subject of criticism, most notably for policy and interface changes, allegations of censorship, and illegal or improper content uploaded by users.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\nInstagram began development in San Francisco, when Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger chose to focus their multi-featured HTML5 check-in project, Burbn, on mobile photography. As Krieger reasoned, Burbn became too similar to Foursquare, and both realized that it had gone too far. Burbn was then pivoted to become more focused on photo-sharing. The word Instagram is a portmanteau of instant camera and telegram.On March 5, 2010, Systrom closed a $500,000 seed funding round with Baseline Ventures and Andreessen Horowitz while working on Burbn. Josh Riedel joined the company in October as Community Manager, Shayne Sweeney joined in November as an engineer, and Jessica Zollman joined as a Community Evangelist in August 2011.Kevin Systrom posted the first photo to Instagram on July 16, 2010. The photo shows a dog in Mexico and Systrom's girlfriend's foot; the photo has been enhanced using Instagram's X-PRO2 filter.On October 6, 2010, the Instagram iOS app was officially released through the App Store.In February 2011, it was reported that Instagram had raised $7 million in Series A funding from a variety of investors, including Benchmark Capital, Jack Dorsey, Chris Sacca (through Capital fund), and Adam D'Angelo. The deal valued Instagram at around $20 million.On April 3, 2012, Instagram was released for Android phones, and it was downloaded more than one million times in less than one day.In March 2012, The Wall Street Journal reported that Instagram was raising a new round of financing that would value the company at $500 million, details that were confirmed the following month, when Instagram raised $50 million from venture capitalists with a $500 million valuation. The same month, Facebook bought Instagram for $1 billion in cash and stock, with a plan to keep the company independently managed. Britain's Office of Fair Trading approved the deal on August 14, 2012, and on August 22, 2012, the Federal Trade Commission in the U.S. closed its investigation, allowing the deal to proceed. On September 6, 2012, the deal between Instagram and Facebook was officially closed.The deal, which was made just prior to Facebook's scheduled IPO, cost about a quarter of Facebook's cash-on-hand, according to figures documented at the end of 2011. The deal was for a company characterized as having \\\"lots of buzz but no business model\\\", and the price was contrasted with the $35 million Yahoo! paid for Flickr in 2005. Mark Zuckerberg noted that Facebook was \\\"committed to building and growing Instagram independently\\\", in contrast to its past practices. According to Wired, the deal netted Systrom $400 million based on his ownership stake in the business. The exact purchase price was $300 million in cash and 23 million shares of stock.In November 2012, Instagram launched website profiles, allowing anyone to see users' feeds from their web browsers. However, the website interface was limited in functionality, with notable omissions including the lack of a search bar, a news feed, and the ability to upload photos. In February 2013, the website was updated to offer a news feed, and in June 2015, the website was redesigned to offer bigger photos.On October 22, 2013, during the Nokia World event held in Abu Dhabi, Systrom confirmed the upcoming release of the official Instagram app for Windows Phone, after pressure from Nokia and the public to develop an app for the platform. The app was released as a beta version on November 21, 2013, and was lacking the ability to record and upload video, though an Instagram spokesperson stated that \\\"We're not finished, and our team will continue developing the Windows Phone app to keep releasing features and bringing you the best Instagram possible\\\". In April 2016, Instagram upgraded the app to Windows 10 Mobile, adding support for video and direct messages, followed by later updates in October 2016 that extended the app to Windows 10 personal computers and tablets.The Android app has received two major exclusive updates. The first, introduced in March 2014, cut the size of the app by half and added significant improvements to performance and responsiveness on a wide variety of Android devices. The Verge wrote that the development team had tested the app on devices not for sale in the United States, particularly low-end models like Samsung Galaxy Y, in an effort to improve the app for its userbase located outside the U.S. Engineering manager Philip McAllister told The Verge that \\\"More than 60 percent of our users are outside the US, and Android covers roughly half of total Instagram users\\\". The second update, introduced in April 2017, added an offline mode, in which content previously loaded in the news feed is available without an Internet connection, and users can comment, like, save media, and unfollow users, all of which will take effect once the user goes back online. At the time of the announcement, it was reported that 80% of Instagram's 600 million users are located outside the U.S., and while the aforementioned functionality was live at announcement, Instagram also announced its intention to make more features available offline \\\"in the following months\\\", and that they were \\\"exploring an iOS version\\\".Since the app's launch it had used the Foursquare API technology to provide named location tagging. In March 2014, Instagram started testing switching the technology to using Facebook Places.Announced in March 2016 and taking place in June, Instagram switched from a strictly chronological oldest-to-newest news feed to a new, algorithm-based feed. The change received \\\"widespread outcry\\\" following Instagram's March announcement, but Instagram stated that the feature would help users discover lost posts, writing that \\\"You may be surprised to learn that people miss on average 70 percent of their feeds. As Instagram has grown, it's become harder to keep up with all the photos and videos people share. This means you often don't see the posts you might care about the most. To improve your experience, your feed will soon be ordered to show the moments we believe you will care about the most.\\\"On May 11, 2016, Instagram revamped its design, adding a black-and-white theme for the app and a more abstract, \\\"modern\\\" and colorful icon. Rumors of a redesign first started circulating in April, when The Verge received a screenshot from a tipster, but at the time, an Instagram spokesperson simply told the publication that \\\"This is a design test only\\\".\\n\\n\\n== Features and tools ==\\n\\nUsers can upload photographs and short videos, follow other users' feeds, and geotag images with the name of a location. Users can set their account as \\\"private\\\", thereby requiring that they approve any new follower requests. Users can connect their Instagram account to other social networking sites, enabling them to share uploaded photos to those sites. In January 2011, Instagram introduced hashtags to help users discover both photos and each other. Instagram encourages users to make tags both specific and relevant, rather than tagging generic words like \\\"photo\\\", to make photographs stand out and to attract like-minded Instagram users. In September 2011, a new version of the app included new and live filters, instant tilt-shift, high-resolution photographs, optional borders, one-click rotation, and an updated icon. In August 2015, Instagram started allowing users to upload full-size landscape and portrait photos and videos onto the service, dropping the previous requirement of a square frame. In August 2016, Instagram added a zoom feature that allows users to pinch-to-zoom the screen to virtually zoom in on photos and videos. In September 2016, Instagram removed Photo Maps, which previously allowed users to see a map of their geotagged photos. An Instagram spokesperson stated that \\\"Photo Map was not widely used, so we've decided to remove the feature and focus on other priorities\\\". In December 2016, Instagram introduced a feature letting users save photos for later viewing. Bookmarked posts get added to a private page in the app. The feature was updated in April 2017 to let users organize saved posts into different collections.In February 2017, Instagram announced that users would be able to upload up to ten pictures or videos to one post, with the content appearing as a swipeable carousel. The feature originally limited photos to the square format, but received an update in August to enable portrait and landscape photos instead. In May, Instagram updated its mobile website to allow users to upload photos, and to add a \\\"lightweight\\\" version of the Explore tab. Later in May, Instagram added an \\\"Archive\\\" feature, letting users hide posts in a private storage area, out of visibility for the public and other users. The move was seen as a way to prevent users from deleting photos that don't garner a desired number of \\\"likes\\\" or are deemed boring, but also as a way to limit the \\\"emergent behavior\\\" of deleting photos, which deprives the service of content. In August, Instagram announced that it would start organizing comments into threads, letting users more easily interact with replies. In April 2018, Instagram launched its version of a portrait mode called \\\"focus mode,\\\" which gently blurs the background of a photo or video while keeping the subject in focus when selected.\\n\\n\\n=== Explore ===\\nIn June 2012, Instagram introduced \\\"Explore\\\", a tab inside the app that displays popular photos, photos taken at nearby locations, and search. The tab was updated in June 2015 to feature trending tags and places, curated content, and the ability to search for locations. In April 2016, Instagram added a \\\"Videos You Might Like\\\" channel to the tab, followed by an \\\"Events\\\" channel in August, featuring videos from concerts, sports games, and other live events, followed by the addition of Instagram Stories in October. The tab was later expanded again in November 2016 after Instagram Live launched to display an algorithmically-curated page of the \\\"best\\\" Instagram Live videos currently airing. In May 2017, Instagram once again updated the Explore tab to promote public Stories content from nearby places.\\n\\n\\n=== Photographic filters ===\\nInstagram offers a number of photographic filters that users can apply to their images:\\n\\nIn February 2012, Instagram added a \\\"Lux\\\" filter, an effect that \\\"lightens shadows, darkens highlights and increases contrast\\\".In December 2014, Slumber, Crema, Ludwig, Aden, and Perpetua were five new filters to be added to the Instagram filter family.\\n\\n\\n=== Video ===\\nInitially a purely photo-sharing service, Instagram incorporated 15-second video sharing in June 2013. The addition was seen by some in the technology media as Facebook's attempt at competing with then-popular video-sharing application Vine. In August 2015, Instagram added support for widescreen videos. In March 2016, Instagram increased the 15-second video limit to 60 seconds. Albums were introduced in February 2017, which allow up to 10 minutes of video to be shared in one post.\\n\\n\\n==== IGTV ====\\n\\nIGTV is a vertical video application launched by Instagram in June 2018. Basic functionality is also available within the Instagram app and website. IGTV allows uploads of up to 10 minutes in length with a file size of up to 650 MB, with verified and popular users allowed to upload videos of up to 60 minutes in length with a file size of up to 5.4 GB. The app automatically begins playing videos as soon as it is launched, which CEO Kevin Systrom contrasted to video hosts where one must first locate a video.\\n\\n\\n=== Instagram Direct ===\\nIn December 2013, Instagram announced Instagram Direct, a feature that lets users interact through private messaging. Users who follow each other can send private messages with photos and videos, in contrast to the public-only requirement that was previously in place. When users receive a private message from someone they don't follow, the message is marked as pending and the user must accept to see it. Users can send a photo to a maximum of 15 people. The feature received a major update in September 2015, adding conversation threading and making it possible for users to share locations, hashtag pages, and profiles through private messages directly from the news feed. Additionally, users can now reply to private messages with text, emoji or by clicking on a heart icon. A camera inside Direct lets users take a photo and send it to the recipient without leaving the conversation. A new update in November 2016 let users make their private messages \\\"disappear\\\" after being viewed by the recipient, with the sender receiving a notification if the recipient takes a screenshot. In April 2017, Instagram redesigned Direct to combine all private messages, both permanent and ephemeral, into the same message threads. In May, Instagram made it possible to send website links in messages, and also added support for sending photos in their original portrait or landscape orientation without cropping.\\n\\n\\n=== Instagram Stories ===\\nIn August 2016, Instagram launched Instagram Stories, a feature that allows users to take photos, add effects and layers, and add them to their Instagram story. Images uploaded to a user's story expire after 24 hours. The media noted the feature's similarities to Snapchat. In November, Instagram added live video functionality to Instagram Stories, allowing users to broadcast themselves live, with the video disappearing immediately after ending. In January 2017, Instagram launched skippable ads, where five-second photo and 15-second video ads appear in-between different stories. In April 2017, Instagram Stories incorporated augmented reality stickers, a \\\"clone\\\" of Snapchat's functionality. In May 2017, Instagram expanded the augmented reality sticker feature to support face filters, letting users add specific visual features onto their faces. Later in May, TechCrunch reported about tests of a Location Stories feature in Instagram Stories, where public Stories content at a certain location are compiled and displayed on a business, landmark or place's Instagram page. A few days later, Instagram announced \\\"Story Search\\\", in which users can search for geographic locations or hashtags and the app displays relevant public Stories content featuring the search term. In June 2017, Instagram revised its live-video functionality to allow users to add their live broadcast to their story for availability in the next 24 hours, or discard the broadcast immediately. In July, Instagram started allowing users to respond to Stories content by sending photos and videos, complete with Instagram effects such as filters, stickers, and hashtags. Stories were made available for viewing on Instagram's mobile and desktop websites in late August 2017.In response to criticism that it copied functionality from Snapchat, CEO Kevin Systrom told Recode that \\\"Day One: Instagram was a combination of Hipstamatic, Twitter [and] some stuff from Facebook like the 'Like' button. You can trace the roots of every feature anyone has in their app, somewhere in the history of technology\\\". Although Systrom acknowledged the criticism as \\\"fair\\\", Recode wrote that \\\"he likened the two social apps' common features to the auto industry: Multiple car companies can coexist, with enough differences among them that they serve different consumer audiences\\\". Systrom further stated that \\\"When we adopted [Stories], we decided that one of the really annoying things about the format is that it just kept going and you couldn't pause it to look at something, you couldn't rewind. We did all that, we implemented that.\\\" He also told the publication that Snapchat \\\"didn't have filters, originally. They adopted filters because Instagram had filters and a lot of others were trying to adopt filters as well.\\\"\\n\\n\\n=== Monetization ===\\nFollowing Emily White's appointment to the position of Director of Business Operations in April 2013, she stated in an interview with The Wall Street Journal in September 2013 that the company should be ready to begin selling advertising by September 2014 as a way to generate business from a popular entity that had not yet created profit for its parent company. White left Instagram, however, in December 2013, to join Snapchat. In August 2014, James Quarles was hired as Instagram's Global Head of Business and Brand Development, a new position within the company focused on overseeing advertisement and sales efforts while developing new \\\"monetization products\\\", according to a spokesperson.In October 2013, Instagram began its monetization efforts, announcing that, \\\"over the next couple of months\\\", video and image ads would start appearing in between users' photos in the news feed for users in the United States. A sample ad from Instagram, featuring the text \\\"Sponsored\\\" at the top right of the image, was the first to be released, with a limited number of brands being allowed to advertise in the early stages. Image advertisements officially started appearing in feeds starting November 1, 2013, followed by video ads on October 30, 2014. In June 2014, Instagram announced the then-upcoming rollout of ads in the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia, planned for \\\"later this year\\\". The same sample ad from Instagram's launch in the U.S. was shown to users in the United Kingdom in September 2014, with ads rolling out \\\"over the coming weeks\\\".In March 2015, it announced that it would allow advertisers to buy \\\"carousel ads\\\", a way for brands to upload up to five images that users can swipe through, with options at the end for additional content or a visit to the brand's website. Following strong performance of the ad format, Instagram opened up a self-service feature for brands to buy carousel ads the following October, and in March 2016, it started allowing video in carousel ads.In May 2016, Instagram announced the launch of new tools for business accounts, including new business profiles, Insights analytics and the ability to turn posts into ads directly from the Instagram app itself. However, to be eligible for the tools, businesses had to have a Facebook Page, with Quarles stating: \\\"In doing that, it gives us the payment credentials, as well as if they want to prepopulate some of the information like their street address, the phone number, and the website\\\". The Instagram Insights panel, which lets businesses see their top posts, reach, impressions and engagement surrounding their posts as well as user demographics, was rolled out first to the United States, Australia, and New Zealand, with the rest of the world \\\"by the end of the year\\\".In February 2016, Instagram announced that it had 200,000 advertisers on the platform. This increased to 500,000 active advertisers in September 2016, and one million in March 2017.\\n\\n\\n=== Stand-alone apps ===\\nInstagram has developed and released three stand-alone apps with specialized functionality. In July 2014, it released Bolt, a messaging app where users click on a friend's profile photo to quickly send an image, with the content disappearing after being seen. It was followed by the release of Hyperlapse in August, a then-iOS-exclusive app that uses \\\"clever algorithm processing\\\" to create tracking shots and fast time-lapse videos. Hyperlapse launched on Android and Windows in May 2015. In October 2015, it released Boomerang, a video app that combines photos into short, one-second videos that play back-and-forth in a loop.\\n\\n\\n=== Third-party services ===\\nThe popularity of Instagram has led to a variety of third-party services using its functionality and adopting it into formats not officially supported. Examples include services for getting an overview of user statistics, printing photos at social events, turning a large number of photos into thumbnails for a physical book or a large poster, and dedicated apps for viewing Instagram on Mac personal computers.\\n\\n\\n=== Virtual models ===\\nMultiple Instagram models are virtual, such as Lil Miquela, a CGI model created by the Los Angeles startup Brud. Lil Miquela acts as an \\\"influencer\\\", promoting clothing and beauty products. Brud has not clarified if these posts are sponsored. The CGI model \\\"Shudu\\\" is another example of the virtual model phenomenon.\\n\\n\\n== User characteristics and behavior ==\\n\\n\\n=== Users ===\\n\\nFollowing the release in October, Instagram had one million registered users in December 2010. In June 2011, it announced that it had 5 million users, which increased to 10 million in September. This growth continued to 30 million users in April 2012, 80 million in July 2012, 100 million in February 2013, 130 million in June 2013, 150 million in September 2013, 300 million in December 2014, 400 million in September 2015, 500 million in June 2016, 600 million in December 2016, 700 million in April 2017, and 800 million in September 2017.In October 2016, Instagram Stories reached 100 million active users, two months after launch. This increased to 150 million in January 2017, 200 million in April, surpassing Snapchat's user growth, and 250 million active users in June 2017.In April 2017, Instagram Direct had 375 million monthly users.In June 2011, Instagram passed 100 million photos uploaded to the service. This grew to 150 million in August 2011, and by June 2013, there were over 16 billion photos on the service. In October 2015, there existed over 40 billion photos.On August 9, 2012, English musician Ellie Goulding released a new music video for her song \\\"Anything Could Happen.\\\" The video only contained fan-submitted Instagram photographs that used various filters to represent words or lyrics from the song, and over 1,200 different photographs were submitted.Instagram was listed among Time's \\\"50 Best Android Applications for 2013\\\" list.\\n\\n\\n==== Demographics ====\\nInstagram's users are divided equally with 50% iPhone owners and 50% Android owners. While Instagram has a neutral gender-bias format, 68% of Instagram users are female while 32% are male. Instagram's geographical use is shown to favor urban areas as 17% of US adults who live in urban areas use Instagram while only 11% of adults in suburban and rural areas do so. While Instagram may appear to be one of the most widely used sites for photo sharing, only 7% of daily photo uploads, among the top four photo-sharing platforms, come from Instagram. Instagram has been proven to attract the younger generation with 90% of the 150 million users under the age of 35. From June 2012 to June 2013, Instagram approximately doubled their number of users. As regards income, 15% of US Internet users who make less than $30,000 per year use Instagram, while 14% of those making $30,000 to $50,000, and 12% of users who make more than $50,000 per year do so. With respect to the education demographic, respondents with some college education proved to be the most active on Instagram with 23%. Following behind, college graduates consist of 18% and users with a high school diploma or less make up 15%. Among these Instagram users, 24% say they use the app several times a day.\\n\\n\\n=== User engagement ===\\nOngoing research continues to explore how media content on the platform affects user engagement. Past research has found that media which show peoples' faces receive more 'likes' and comments and that using filters that increase warmth, exposure, and contrast also boosts engagement. Users are more likely to engage with images that depict fewer individuals compared to groups and also are more likely to engage with content that has not been watermarked, as they view this content as less original and reliable compared to user-generated content.\\n\\n\\n=== Trends ===\\nUsers on Instagram have created \\\"trends\\\" through hashtags, which are specific keywords combined with a hash symbol that lets them share content with other Instagram users. The trends deemed the most popular on the platform often highlight a specific day of the week to post the material on. Examples of popular trends include #SelfieSunday, in which users post a photo of their faces on Sundays; #MotivationMonday, in which users post motivational photos on Mondays; #TransformationTuesday, in which users post photos highlighting differences from the past to the present; #WomanCrushWednesday, in which users post photos of women they have a romantic interest in or view favorably, as well as its #ManCrushMonday counterpart centered on men; and #ThrowbackThursday, in which users post a photo from their past, highlighting a particular moment.In December 2017, The Verge reported that Instagram would let users press \\\"Follow\\\" on a hashtag, thereby seeing relevant highlights of the topic in their feeds.\\n\\n\\n== Criticism ==\\n\\n\\n=== Content ownership ===\\nOn December 17, 2012, Instagram announced a change to its Terms of Service policy, adding the following sentence:\\nThere was no option for users to opt out of the changed Terms of Service without deleting their accounts before the new policy went into effect on January 16, 2013. The move garnered severe criticism from users, prompting Instagram CEO Kevin Systrom to write a blog post one day later, announcing that they would \\\"remove\\\" the offending language from the policy. Citing misinterpretations about its intention to \\\"communicate that we'd like to experiment with innovative advertising that feels appropriate on Instagram\\\", Systrom also stated that it was \\\"our mistake that this language is confusing\\\" and that \\\"it is not our intention to sell your photos\\\". Furthermore, he wrote that they would work on \\\"updated language in the terms to make sure this is clear\\\".The policy change and its backlash caused competing photo services to use the opportunity to \\\"try to lure users away\\\" by advertising their privacy-friendly services, and some services experienced substantial gains in momentum and user growth following the news. On December 20, Instagram announced that the advertising section of the policy would be reverted to its original October 2010 version. The Verge wrote about that policy as well, however, noting that the original policy gives the company right to \\\"place such advertising and promotions on the Instagram Services or on, about, or in conjunction with your Content\\\", meaning that \\\"Instagram has always had the right to use your photos in ads, almost any way it wants. We could have had the exact same freakout last week, or a year ago, or the day Instagram launched\\\".The policy update also introduced an arbitration clause, which remained even after the language pertaining to advertising and user content had been modified.\\n\\n\\n=== Illicit drugs ===\\nInstagram has been the subject of criticism due to users publishing images of drugs they are selling on the platform. In 2013, the BBC discovered that users, mostly located in the United States, were posting images of drugs they were selling, attaching specific hashtags, and then completing transactions via instant messaging applications such as WhatsApp. Corresponding hashtags have been blocked as part of the company's response and a spokesperson engaged with the BBC explained:\\n\\nInstagram has a clear set of rules about what is and isn't allowed on the site. We encourage people who come across illegal or inappropriate content to report it to us using the built-in reporting tools next to every photo, video or comment, so we can take action. People can't buy things on Instagram, we are simply a place where people share photos and videos.\\n\\nHowever, new incidents of illegal drug trade have occurred in the aftermath of the 2013 revelation, with Facebook, Instagram's parent company, asking users who come across such content to report the material, at which time a \\\"dedicated team\\\" reviews the information.\\n\\n\\n=== Allegations of censorship ===\\nIn October 2013, Instagram deleted the account of Canadian photographer Petra Collins after she posted a photo of herself in which a very small area of pubic hair was visible above the top of her bikini bottom. Collins claimed that the account deletion was unfounded because it did not break any of Instagram's terms and conditions. Audra Schroeder of The Daily Dot further wrote that \\\"Instagram's terms of use state users can't post \\\"pornographic or sexually suggestive photos,\\\" but who actually gets to decide that? You can indeed find more sexually suggestive photos on the site than Collins', where women show the side of \\\"femininity\\\" the world is \\\"used to\\\" seeing and accepting.\\\" Nick Drewe of The Daily Beast wrote a report the same month focusing on hashtags that users are unable to search for, including #sex, #bubblebutt, and #ballsack, despite allowing #faketits, #gunsforsale and #sexytimes, calling the discrepancy \\\"nonsensical and inconsistent\\\".Similar incidents occurred in January 2015, when Instagram deleted Australian fashion agency Sticks and Stones Agency's account because of a photograph including pubic hair sticking out of bikini bottoms, and March 2015, when artist and poet Rupi Kaur's photos of menstrual blood on clothing were removed, prompting a rallying post on her Facebook and Tumblr accounts with the text \\\"We will not be censored\\\", gaining over 11,000 shares.The incidents have led to a #FreetheNipple campaign, aimed at challenging Instagram's removal of photos displaying women's nipples. Although Instagram has not made many comments on the campaign, an October 2015 explanation from CEO Kevin Systrom highlighted Apple's content guidelines for apps published through its App Store, including Instagram, in which apps must designate the appropriate age ranking for users, with the app's current rating being 12+ years of age. However, this statement has also been called into question due to other apps with more explicit content allowed on the store, the lack of consequences for men exposing their bodies on Instagram, and for inconsistent treatment of what constitutes inappropriate exposure of the female body.\\n\\n\\n=== Hidden pornography ===\\nIn March 2016, Daily Star reported that a blogger had discovered \\\"one million\\\" explicit pornography films on Instagram. Users uploading such content, which violates Instagram's community guidelines, avoid detection by using Arabic hashtags. A company spokesperson told The Sun that \\\"We have zero tolerance for pornographic content. We invest in extensive controls, easy reporting and the best available technology to flag and swiftly remove violating content and accounts.\\\"\\n\\n\\n=== Timeline algorithm ===\\nIn April 2016, Instagram began rolling out a change to the order of photos visible in a user's timeline, shifting from a strictly chronological order to one determined by an algorithm. Instagram said the algorithm was designed so that users would see more of the photos by users that they liked, but there was significant negative feedback, with many users asking their followers to turn on post notifications in order to make sure they see updates. The company wrote a tweet to users upset at the prospect of the change, but did not back down, nor provide a way to change it back.\\n\\n\\n=== Negative comments ===\\nIn response to abusive and negative comments on users' photos, Instagram has made efforts to give users more control over their posts and accompanying comments field. In July 2016, it announced that users would be able to turn off comments for their posts, as well as control the language used in comments by inputting words they consider offensive, which will ban applicable comments from showing up. After the July 2016 announcement, the ability to ban specific words began rolling out early August to celebrities, followed by regular users in September. In December, the company began rolling out the abilities for users to turn off the comments and, for private accounts, remove followers.In September 2017, the company announced that public users would be able to limit who can comment on their content, such as only their followers or people they follow. At the same time, it updated its automated comment filter to support additional languages.In June 2017, Instagram announced that it had introduced a new comment moderation system, that will automatically attempt to filter offensive, harassing, and \\\"spammy\\\" comments by default. The system is built using a Facebook-developed deep learning algorithm known as DeepText (first implemented on the social network to detect spam comments), which utilizes natural-language processing techniques, and can also filter by user-specified keywords.\\n\\n\\n=== Mental health ===\\nIn May 2017, a survey conducted by United Kingdom's Royal Society for Public Health, featuring 1,479 people aged 14-24, asking them to rate social media platforms depending on anxiety, depression, loneliness, bullying and body image, concluded that Instagram was \\\"worst for young mental health\\\". In response, Instagram stated that \\\"Keeping Instagram a safe and supportive place for young people was a top priority\\\".In 2017, researchers from Harvard University and University of Vermont demonstrated a machine-learning tool that successfully outperformed general practitioners' diagnostic success rate for depression. The tool used color analysis, metadata components, and face-detection of users' feeds.\\n\\n\\n=== \\\"Shadowban\\\" ===\\nIn mid-2017, reports surfaced that Instagram had begun efforts to reduce the prominence of accounts using many irrelevant hashtags to increase their respective reach on the social network and users who pay money to a service in order to receive a high amount of post engagement. Known as \\\"shadowbanning\\\", the effort hides applicable accounts from appearing in search results and in the app's Explore section. In a now-deleted Facebook post, Instagram wrote that \\\"When developing content, we recommend focusing on your business objective or goal rather than hashtags\\\".\\n\\n\\n=== Algorithmic advertisement with rape threat ===\\nIn 2016, Olivia Solon, a reporter for The Guardian, posted a screenshot to her Instagram profile of an email she had received containing threats of rape and murder towards her. The photo post had received three likes and countless comments, and in September 2017, the company's algorithms turned the photo into an advertisement visible to Solon's sister. An Instagram spokesperson apologized and told The Guardian that \\\"We are sorry this happened - it's not the experience we want someone to have. This notification post was surfaced as part of an effort to encourage engagement on Instagram. Posts are generally received by a small percentage of a person's Facebook friends\\\". As noted by the technology media, the incident occurred at the same time parent company Facebook was under scrutiny for its algorithms and advertising campaigns being used for offensive and negative purposes.\\n\\n\\n=== August 2017 hack ===\\nIn August 2017, reports surfaced that a bug in Instagram's developer tools had allowed \\\"one or more individuals\\\" to gain access to the contact information, specifically email addresses and phone numbers, of several high-profile verified accounts, including its most followed user, Selena Gomez. The company said in a statement that it had \\\"fixed the bug swiftly\\\" and was running an investigation. However, the following month, more details emerged, with a group of hackers selling contact information online, with the affected number of accounts in the \\\"millions\\\" rather than the previously-assumed limitation on verified accounts. Hours after the hack, a searchable database was posted online, charging $10 per search. The Daily Beast was provided with a sample of the affected accounts, and could confirm that, while many of the email addresses could be found with a Google search in public sources, some did not return relevant Google search results and thus were from private sources. The Verge wrote that cybersecurity firm RepKnight had found contact information for multiple actors, musicians, and athletes, and singer Selena Gomez's account was used by the hackers to post naked photos of her ex-boyfriend Justin Bieber. The company admitted that \\\"we cannot determine which specific accounts may have been impacted\\\", but believed that \\\"it was a low percentage of Instagram accounts\\\", though TechCrunch stated in its report that six million accounts were affected by the hack, and that \\\"Instagram services more than 700 million accounts; six million is not a small number\\\".\\n\\n\\n== Censorship ==\\nCensorship of Instagram has occurred in several different countries.\\n\\n\\n=== China ===\\n\\nInstagram has been blocked by China following the 2014 Hong Kong protests because a lot of videos and photos are posted. Hong Kong and Macau was not affected as they are special administrative regions of China.\\n\\n\\n=== Turkey ===\\nTurkey is also known for its strict internet censorship and periodically blocks social media including Instagram.\\n\\n\\n=== North Korea ===\\n\\nA few days after a fire incident that happened in the Koryo Hotel of North Korea in June 11, 2015, authorities has begun to block Instagram to prevent photos of the incident being spread out.\\n\\n\\n== Awards ==\\nInstagram was the runner-up for \\\"Best Mobile App\\\" at the 2010 TechCrunch Crunchies in January 2011. In May 2011, Fast Company listed CEO Kevin Systrom at number 66 in \\\"The 100 Most Creative People in Business in 2011\\\". In June 2011, Inc. included co-founders Systrom and Krieger in its 2011 \\\"30 Under 30\\\" list.Instagram won \\\"Best Locally Made App\\\" in the SF Weekly Web Awards in September 2011. 7x7Magazine's September 2011 issue featured Systrom and Krieger on the cover of their \\\"The Hot 20 2011\\\" issue. In December 2011, Apple Inc. named Instagram the \\\"App of the Year\\\" for 2011. In 2015, Instagram was named No. 1 by Mashable on its list of \\\"The 100 best iPhone apps of all time,\\\" noting Instagram as \\\"one of the most influential social networks in the world.\\\"\\n\\n\\n== In popular culture ==\\nInstagram model: a term for models who gain their success as a result of the large number of followers they have on Instagram.\\nInstagram Pier: a cargo working area in Hong Kong that gained its nickname due to its popularity on Instagram.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nHyperlapse\\nDronestagram\\nGifBoom\\nPheed\\nPixnet\\nTimeline of social media\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nOfficial website\\nCompany headquarters page on Facebook's official website\\n\\\"#Nofilter\\\" podcast with the founders of Instagram (May 30, 2013)\\nHow I Built This podcast - Instagram: Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger\", \"rev_id\": 857582055, \"accessed\": \"2018-09-03 00:23:59.864295\", \"links\": [\"Windows 10 Mobile\", \"Wired (magazine)\", \"WhatsApp\", \"The Sun (United Kingdom)\", \"TechCrunch\", \"Fast Company (magazine)\", \"Daily Star (British newspaper)\", \"Benchmark Capital\", \"Dronestagram\", \"Photographic filter\", \"Hong Kong\", \"Snapchat\", \"Pheed\", \"Harvard University\", \"Office of Fair Trading\", \"Adam D'Angelo\", \"2014 Hong Kong protests\", \"Andreessen Horowitz\", \"The Daily Beast\", \"The Verge\", \"Mark Zuckerberg\", \"Emily White\", \"The Daily Dot\", \"Lil Miquela\", \"Android (operating system)\", \"IGTV\", \"Wired (website)\", \"Anything Could Happen\", \"SF Weekly\", \"7x7 (magazine)\", \"Royal Society for Public Health\", \"Facebook\", \"M (virtual assistant)\", \"Inc.

It was said to be like a combination of Jackass and Chappelle's Show. The show was originally going to be named Blackass, a portmanteau of the TV series Jackass and the fact that most of the cast is black. This was however, changed to the title's current variation of Loiter Squad. It was not until September 8, 2011 that the show was finally confirmed as a 15-minute live action show composed of various sketches, man on the street segments, pranks and music made by Odd Future. Dickhouse Productions, the production partnership that created Jackass, produces the show.\\nLoiter Squad premiered on Sunday, March 25, 2012 on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim programming block, rated TV-14-DLSV. Episode 4 featured an appearance from Jackass alumnus Johnny Knoxville while fellow Jackass cast members Bam Margera, Chris Pontius and Dave England have also made guest appearances. Other appearances have included rappers Xzibit, Lil Wayne and Juicy J, and actor Seth Rogen. In 2012, it was announced that Earl Sweatshirt and Blake Anderson would join the cast at the show's second season.\\nLoiter Squad was renewed for a third season and premiered on May 15, 2014. It was produced by Gorilla Flicks, the new production company of Jeff Tremaine, and by Camp Flog Gnaw, the production company of Tyler the Creator.\\nIn July 2015, Tyler, the Creator stated that Loiter Squad would not continue for a fourth season.\\n\\n\\n== Cast ==\\n\\n\\n=== Season 1 ===\\nTyler Haley\\nDavon Wilson\\nTravis Bennett\\nLionel Boyce\\n\\n\\n== Episodes ==\\n\\n\\n=== Season 1 (2012) ===\\n\\n\\n=== Season 2 (2013) ===\\n\\n\\n=== Season 3 (2014) ===\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nOdd Future\\nDickhouse Productions\\nTyler, the Creator\\nJasper Dolphin\\nEarl Sweatshirt\\nThe Jellies!\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nLoiter Squad on IMDb\", \"rev_id\": 848394670, \"accessed\": \"2018-09-03 00:23:59.864295\", \"links\": [\"Adult Swim\", \"Taco Bennett\", \"Dave England\", \"Los Angeles\", \"Jasper Dolphin\", \"Flog Gnaw\", \"Jeff Tremaine\", \"Johnny Knoxville\", \"Keith Crofford\", \"Chappelle's Show\", \"Xzibit\", \"Odd Future\", \"Juicy J\", \"Seth Rogen\", \"TV-14\", \"Earl Sweatshirt\", \"Tyler, the Creator\", \"Chris Pontius\", \"Earl (mixtape)\", \"Lil Wayne\", \"The Jellies!\", \"Blake Anderson\", \"Bam Margera\", \"Cartoon Network\", \"Jackass (TV series)\", \"Lance Bangs\", \"Nick Weidenfeld\", \"Dimitry Elyashkevich\", \"IMDb\", \"Dickhouse Productions\"]}, {\"title\": \"The Internet\", \"link_id\": \"The Internet (band)\", \"summary\": \"The Internet is an American band from Los Angeles, California.

The band's name originally started out as a joke, inspired by Left Brain's answer to a reporter asking where he was from, to which he responded, \\\"I hate when people ask me that, I'm going to start saying I'm from the Internet\\\". The idea amused Syd, and inspired the name for her side project that eventually became The Internet.\\nTheir debut album Purple Naked Ladies was released on December 20, 2011. It was the first Odd Future album to be released through Odd Future Records. Two songs from the album, \\\"Cocaine\\\" and \\\"Fastlane\\\", had music videos to accompany their release. The Internet has a song included on the Odd Future album The OF Tape Vol. 2, called \\\"Ya know\\\".The band released their second album Feel Good in September 2013, and received praise from fans and critics. The first single from the album, \\\"Give It Time\\\", was released through Odd Future's official SoundCloud. On June 10, 2013, The band backed Mac Miller in London in promotion of his second album Watching Movies with the Sound Off.\\nTheir third album Ego Death was released by Odd Future & Columbia on June 30, 2015 to widespread acclaim. Matt Martians on NPR said about the album's title: \\\"A lot of people that we know [are] just having their egos checked in many ways. Some people losing their jobs when, last year, they were at the top of the mountain; certain people's careers going in different directions that they didn't anticipate. And just kind of two words that you want people to think about these days, because we do have a lot of people who, on the Internet -- whether it's Instagram, Twitter -- it's a lot of egos that are really based on nothing backing it up.\\\"Following the release of Ego Death, the band's members each focused on releasing individual solo projects. 2017 saw the release of Matt Martians' The Drum Chord Theory, Syd's Fin, Steve Lacy's Demo, Patrick Paige II's Letters of Irrelevance and Christopher A. Smith's Loud, as a part of the duo C&T.\\nIn December 2017, Steve Lacy told DJ Matt Wilkinson of Beats 1 that the follow-up to Ego Death was \\\"95%\\\" finished. He added: \\\"I feel like this is on a higher echelon than Ego Death. I love Ego Death, that was a great record, but I know this one is a step up.\\\"In April 2018, Patrick Paige II announced his debut album Letters of Irrelevance. Later that month, the band released the single \\\"Roll (Burbank Funk)\\\", in promotion of a yet-to-be-titled upcoming album. The track features joint lead vocals by Steve Lacy and Syd. The next month the band announced their fourth album, Hive Mind, which arrived on July 20, 2018.

The label releases albums worldwide and operates across a range of genres.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\n\\n=== 1980s and 1990s ===\\nThe label was launched in 1989 to release rave and dance music. It was originally an imprint of Beggars Banquet's more commercial dance label Citybeat, which was known for records by acts such as Freeez, Starlight, Dream Frequency and the Ultramagnetic MCs. However, with the success of acts such as The Prodigy and SL2, XL superseded Citybeat in its lineup.\\nDuring the early nineties, XL releases were dance oriented ranging from Belgium techno (T99 \\\"Anasthasia\\\") to breakbeat hardcore (SL2 \\\"On a Ragga Tip\\\") to drum and bass (Jonny L \\\"I'm Leavin'\\\"). This period of XL's history has been recorded on the XL Recordings Chapters compilation series. In 1993 Halkes left XL to form the EMI-owned commercial dance label Positiva, and subsequently his own independent commercial dance label Incentive. After Palmer retired, Russell took over the running of the business.Russell later broadened the musical horizons of the label whilst maintaining a credo of working with artists he saw as original and inventive. In 1994 the label released The Prodigy's second album, Music for the Jilted Generation which debuted in the UK Albums Chart at number one, and in 1997 it released the third album by The Prodigy, The Fat of the Land which entered the British and American charts at number one and went on to be number one in 26 countries.\\n\\n\\n=== 2000s ===\\nJune 2000 saw the release of Badly Drawn Boy's The Hour of Bewilderbeast which won the 2000 Mercury Music Prize. The next year, The White Stripes third album White Blood Cells was released together with reissues of the band's previous albums, The White Stripes and De Stijl. In 2003 XL Recordings won the Music Week A&R award, and also released The White Stripes fourth album Elephant which was their first UK number one album and eventually reached double platinum certification in Britain. In the same year XL released Dizzee Rascal's first solo album, Boy in da Corner for which Dizzee was awarded the Mercury Prize for the best album of 2003.In March 2005, M.I.A.'s debut album Arular was released after several months delay. Thom Yorke, from Radiohead, released his first solo record, The Eraser, on the label in July 2006. In October 2007, Radiohead completed negotiations to sign with XL for physical release of their seventh studio album, In Rainbows. Radiohead subsequently went on to release through XL, and have so far released everything since their eighth studio album The King Of Limbs on the label. As director of XL Recordings, Richard Russell was included in a 2007 Evening Standard list of the most influential people in London, and in August of that year M.I.A.'s second album Kala was released--Rolling Stone named it the ninth best album of the decade.In March 2008 XL added Friendly Fires and The Horrors. In 2009 the label won the \\\"Music Week\\\" Best Independent Label award; Adele won the awards for Best New Artist and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance at the 51st Annual Grammy Awards, and at the same ceremony Radiohead won Best Alternative Album for In Rainbows as well as Best Boxed or Special Edition Album. Also in 2009, The xx's debut album xx was released on XL Recordings partner label Young Turks, and in September Giggs was signed.\\n\\n\\n=== 2010s ===\\nOn 11 January 2010, XL Recordings released Vampire Weekend's second album Contra. It was the band's first album to reach number one on the US Billboard 200. Gil Scott-Heron's thirteenth studio album I'm New Here was released in February; it was Scott-Heron's first release of original material in sixteen years and proved to be his last studio album. Recording sessions for the album took place between 2007 and 2009 and production was handled by XL Recordings-owner Richard Russell.\\nIn July, XL signed Jai Paul, who was shortlisted for BBC's Sound of 2011, and in September the xx's eponymous debut album won the Barclaycard Mercury Prize, acquiring best British and Irish album of the year.On 24 January 2011, XL Recordings released the album 21 by Adele. In February the (then) 19-year-old OFWGKTA member Tyler, the Creator was signed for a one-album deal for his second studio album and commercial debut Goblin. Singer Gil Scott-Heron died in May and his final recordings, \\\"I'm New Here\\\"  (produced by Richard Russell), and the remix album, \\\"We're New Here\\\" made with Jamie xx were released on XL Recordings. The label also released new albums by Radiohead, Friendly Fires, and The Horrors and singles by Jai Paul and Portishead, as well as the Adele Blu-ray/DVD, Live at the Royal Albert Hall.On 24 April 2012, XL released Blunderbuss, the debut solo record by Jack White. It entered the UK album charts at number one, displacing 21 by Adele.\\nIn 2012, XL Recordings was named 'Label of the Year' at the Music Week Awards in London. XL also won awards for 'Best A&R' and 'Best Artist Campaign'. Label head, Richard Russell, became the youngest ever recipient of the lifetime achievement 'Strat Award'.Sales of Adele's 21 helped increase XL Recordings' bank balance from PS3million to PS32million in the space of 12 months. As of March 2011, XL Recordings had released three albums that had sold over a million copies in the UK: The Prodigy's The Fat of the Land, Adele's 19, and Adele's 21.In April 2016, Radiohead's Parlophone albums transferred to XL Recordings. A month later, on 8 May, the band released their ninth studio album, A Moon Shaped Pool, through XL to critical acclaim.\\nXL's head of A&R was Imran Ahmed from 2014 to 2018. \\n\\n\\n== XL Studio ==\\nIn early 2008, Russell transformed the rear garage of the label's Ladbroke Grove headquarters into a small, in-house recording and mixing studio called XL Studio. It served as a makeshift studio space for the label's various artists and his own projects until producer Rodaidh McDonald was assigned in September of that year to manage and properly equip it in preparation for The xx to record their self-titled debut album. According to McDonald, \\\"before Richard brought me in to be Studio Manager, it was just a bit of a free-for-all. Artists could come in and rehearse, demo or write here and things like that ... but it was good idea and we decided we should be stepping it up and making records here.\\\" Russell and McDonald were inspired by the success of modest studios such as Hitsville U.S.A. and wanted to create an economic, non-commercial space.Set up specifically with the xx in mind, XL Studio features little outboard gear and is equipped with a Neotek Elan custom 24-channel mixing console, Yamaha NS10 studio monitors, and instruments that include an upright piano, Roland Juno-60, Moog Prodigy, Vox Continental organ, and Sequential Circuits Pro-One synthesizer. Russell and McDonald augmented the studio to twice its original size after the xx's album, which was done in what became the studio's control room; they incorporated an adjacent office as the studio's live room for musicians.\\n\\n\\n== Roster ==\\n\\n\\n=== 2018 roster ===\\nAs of 2018, XL Recordings is home to a range of artists including:\\n\\n\\n=== Alumni ===\\n\\n\\n=== Young Turks roster ===\\n\\n\\n=== Terrible Records roster ===\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\n\\n\\n=== Affiliated labels/imprints ===\\nNew Gen\\nTerrible Records\\nYoung Turks\\n\\n\\n=== Inactive affiliated labels/imprints ===\\nAbeano\\nHXC Recordings\\nLocked On\\nSalvia Recordings\\n\\n\\n=== Other ===\\nList of record labels\\nList of electronic music record labels\\nList of independent UK record labels\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nOfficial website\\nXL Recordings discography at Discogs\\nInterview with Richard Russell, HitQuarters Sep 2008\", \"rev_id\": 854509276, \"accessed\": \"2018-09-03 00:23:59.864295\", \"links\": [\"List of electronic music record labels\", \"Jack White (musician)\", \"OFWGKTA\", \"SL2 (group)\", \"Peaches (musician)\", \"Roland Juno-60\", \"A Moon Shaped Pool\", \"Arular\", \"Contra (album)\", \"Sound of 2011\", \"I'm New Here\", \"Music Week\", \"Parlophone\", \"Dizzee Rascal\", \"Music for the Jilted Generation\", \"Giggs (rapper)\", \"Sampha\", \"Goblin (album)\", \"Rodaidh McDonald\", \"De Stijl (album)\", \"The Eraser\", \"XL Recordings Chapters\", \"The Fat of the Land\", \"Friendly Fires\", \"Jamie xx\", \"Evening Standard\", \"Azealia Banks\", \"Adele\", \"Ultramagnetic MCs\", \"Arca (producer)\", \"Electric Six\", \"Rolling Stone\", \"King Krule\", \"Beck\", \"Gotan Project\", \"List of independent UK record labels\", \"The xx\", \"Hitsville U.S.A.\", \"Tyler, the Creator\", \"The Hour of Bewilderbeast\", \"Kala (album)\", \"Discogs\", \"FKA twigs\", \"Richard Russell (XL Recordings)\", \"Gil Scott-Heron\", \"Thom Yorke\", \"The Prodigy\", \"Badly Drawn Boy\", \"Jai Paul\", \"The White Stripes (album)\", \"Radiohead\", \"21 (Adele album)\", \"Mercury Music Prize\", \"Sequential Circuits Pro-One\", \"Terrible Records\", \"M.I.A.

The co-founders were Tyler, the Creator (Tyler Okonma), Left Brain (Vyron Turner), Hodgy Beats (Gerard Long) and Jasper Dolphin (Davon Wilson). Much of the collective's early music was recorded in a room of Syd tha Kyd and Taco's South Central Los Angeles home, known as the Trap House|date=August 2018}} In November 2008, they released their debut mixtape, The Odd Future Tape. At some point before the release of Tyler's mixtape Bastard, Chicago-based rapper brandUn DeShay collaborated with the group, and appeared on the track \\\"Session\\\". Tyler and DeShay later had a falling out, and his vocals on \\\"Session\\\" were replaced by Mike G. \\nDomo Genesis, Earl Sweatshirt, Mike G, and Frank Ocean joined the group between 2009 and 2010.. The group completed a two-stop tour, their first outside Los Angeles: in London, on November 5, 2010, and New York City on November 8. The concert at The Drop in London sold out within 48 hours of announcement. Their concerts have been compared to punk rock shows, with stagediving, moshing, and group members antagonizing the crowd.\\n\\n\\n=== 2011-15: Solo releases and Loiter Squad ===\\n\\nMellowHype re-released their album BlackenedWhite through Fat Possum Records. Frank Ocean self-released his debut mixtape, Nostalgia, Ultra on February 16, 2011 after joining Odd Future. Tyler, the Creator also signed a one-album deal with XL Recordings and released his sophomore effort, Goblin, on May 10, 2011. They have collected a cult following, and have received press attention from blogs and magazines. Though they are often labeled as horrorcore, the group has universally dismissed it on Twitter, in interviews, and on tracks such as \\\"Sandwitches\\\". Pitchfork Media has labeled the group as indie rap. In April 2011, the group signed a deal with RED Distribution and Sony Music Entertainment to start their own label, Odd Future Records. On August 2, 2011, Odd Future announced on their website the Golf Wang Tour 2011. The tour included 27 stops, beginning on September 28, 2011 in San Diego, California at the House of Blues.On September 8, 2011, it was announced that Odd Future would be making a television show called Loiter Squad. The show was announced to be a sketch comedy show featuring various skits and pranks and originally aired on March 25, 2012 on Adult Swim. The show features Tyler, Jasper, Taco, Earl and Lionel as main cast members with other members of Odd Future making cameo appearances. The program is produced by Dickhouse Productions, which also is the production company for Jackass.\\nOn October 3, 2011, Tyler, The Creator tweeted a link to iTunes with a compilation album of 12 old Odd Future songs from artists within the group such as Domo Genesis, Hodgy Beats, Mike G, The Jet Age of Tomorrow, MellowHype, The Internet, and Tyler himself. The album is simply named 12 Odd Future Songs, despite having 13 tracks, including a brand new release by The Internet. On March 20, 2012, the collective released their debut album, The OF Tape Vol. 2. The album was a sequel to the original mixtape, The Odd Future Tape. On the same day, Earl Sweatshirt, who was absent from Odd Future from June 2010 until February 2012, first performed with the group at the Hammerstein Ballroom in New York.Frank Ocean released his debut studio album channel ORANGE on July 17, 2012. Other solo releases for the second half of 2012 included Domo Genesis's No Idols with The Alchemist, released on August 1, and MellowHype's Numbers, released on October 9. On December 5, 2012 it was announced Frank Ocean was nominated for six awards at the 55th Grammys, including Best New Artist, Record of the Year for \\\"Thinkin Bout You\\\" and Album of the Year for channel ORANGE.\\nOn April 2, Tyler, The Creator released his second studio album, Wolf, which received positive reviews from critics and debuted at #3 on the Billboard 200, selling 89,895 copies in the United States. Earl Sweatshirt released his debut studio album Doris on August 20, 2013, which was met with critical acclaim, and MellowHigh released their self-titled debut album together on October 31, 2013.\\n\\nOn September 12, the Odd Future station premiered on the online 24/7 radio, Dash Radio, which was released the month before by DJ Skee. The station features a live playlist, special links such as \\\"Taco Tuesday\\\" (also repeated on Fridays) and coverage of live events, such as the Camp Flog Gnaw Carnival, also hosted by Odd Future.\\n\\n\\n=== 2015-present: Inactivity as a collective ===\\nOn January 18, 2015, Hodgy Beats confirmed that MellowHype will no longer exist, and that he and Left Brain will continue to make music together, just no longer under the name MellowHype. Hodgy states in the interview, \\\"Nah, we ain't breaking up. Nah, this ain't no weirdo shit. It's just some real shit. It's a refocus. Going from boys to men this is what it is. So it's either understand it, 'cause it will be explained-cry about it, talk shit, applaud us-we still moving.\\\" In May 2015, Tyler posted a photo on Twitter from 2010 which contained the entire Odd Future collective. He added \\\"although it's no more, those 7 letters [OFWGKTA] are forever.\\\" This was widely believed to be a confirmation of the collective's dissolution. However, the next day he explained that his tweet was misinterpreted and was merely \\\"looking at old photos with friends and thinking about how time flies.\\\" The next day, member Earl Sweatshirt wrote: \\\"No sympathy for male virgins who're in their feelings about Tyler pointing out and solidifying the obvious.\\\" This caused an Internet debate over whether \\\"the obvious\\\" was referring to Tyler's first statement or his second. On June 30, Matt Martians seemingly confirmed to AllHipHop that Odd Future had indeed broken up, but that there were \\\"no hard feelings among the members of OFWGKTA.\\\"\\\"OFWGKTA\\\" was listed on the bill for Tyler, the Creator's 4th Annual Camp Flog Gnaw Carnival. The line-up that performed included Hodgy Beats, Domo Genesis, Mike G and Left Brain. Tyler and Earl were not a part of the set due to Tyler already having a solo show and Earl having amicably distanced himself from Odd Future around the release of his second album I Don't Like Shit, I Don't Go Outside.\\nDuring the Odd Future set at the 4th Annual Camp Flog Gnaw Carnival, Hodgy Beats called out Tyler, The Creator onstage about his dissatisfaction with Tyler, and remarking how he \\\"stayed broke\\\", and was also visibly irritated when other Odd Future members thanked Tyler for the invite to the carnival. Tyler responded to Hodgy in the middle of his solo set, saying \\\"Niggas got me fucked up. I put too many niggas on. I helped too many of my motherfucking friends out, and niggas gonna come foul? You know who the fuck I'm talking about, nigga. And yes, this is real.\\\" Hodgy responded to these remarks on Twitter by saying \\\"If it wasn't for Odd Future, where would Tyler be?\\\" and \\\"Think about who built the name OF together as a unit. Now think about who took the first initial shit on OF.\\\" However, one day later, a humorous Instagram video, uploaded by Hodgy, featured him and Tyler attempting to perform handstands; possibly suggesting that the feud had been dissolved. The video was later removed.On March 11, 2016, Syd Tha Kyd officially announced her departure from Odd Future, making The Internet only a label associated act. She also stated that she has not thought of herself as a member of Odd Future as a rap group since early 2011 when The Internet formed.On May 2, 2016, the group confirmed that they are still together on their Twitter.Some rumors began to circulate in August-September 2016 about the group working together musically again after a picture was taken of Tyler, The Creator, Earl Sweatshirt, Syd Tha Kyd, Jasper Dolphin, Taco Bennett, and Matt Martians together at the Afropunk Festival.

The group were not on the original bill, but were substituting for Kendrick Lamar after the concert had been sold out. A campaign was launched by an anti-violence group to prevent Odd Future performing, based partly on prior occurrences of the group supposedly inciting violence by their fans towards members of the public, and by the group's lyrics allegedly supporting rape and violence towards women. Immigration New Zealand canceled the visa of some group members because of prior acts of inciting violence, including one where the group allegedly encouraged fans to attack members of the police.As of 2015, Tyler, The Creator has been banned from the United Kingdom for 3-5 years due to the allegedly homophobic and violent content of his lyrics from earlier albums such as Bastard and Goblin.\\n\\n\\n== Discography ==\\n\\n\\n=== Albums ===\\nThe OF Tape Vol. 2 (2012)\\n\\n\\n=== Mixtapes ===\\nThe Odd Future Tape (2008)\\nRadical (2010)\\n\\n\\n=== Compilations ===\\n12 Odd Future Songs (2011)\\n\\n\\n== Awards and nominations ==\\n\\n\\n== Notes ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nOfficial website \\n Media related to Odd Future Wolf Gang Kill Them All at Wikimedia Commons\", \"rev_id\": 856549246, \"accessed\": \"2018-09-03 00:23:59.864295\", \"links\": [\"Adult Swim\", \"RED Distribution\", \"New York City\", \"No Idols\", \"San Diego\", \"I Smell Panties\", \"MellowHigh (album)\", \"Los Angeles\", \"Jasper Dolphin\", \"South Central Los Angeles\", \"Twitter\", \"Domo Genesis\", \"Kendrick Lamar\", \"Wolf (Tyler, the Creator album)\", \"The OF Tape Vol. 2\", \"Numbers (Mellowhype album)\", \"Hammerstein Ballroom\", \"Odd Future\", \"Nostalgia, Ultra\", \"Left Brain\", \"She (Tyler, the Creator song)\", \"Sony Music Entertainment\", \"MellowHype\", \"London\", \"Taco Tuesday\", \"Matt Martians\", \"Odd Future Records\", \"Camp Flog Gnaw Carnival\", \"Sony Music\", \"Earl Sweatshirt\", \"Syd tha Kyd\", \"Tyler, the Creator\", \"Genesis (Domo Genesis album)\", \"Thinkin Bout You\", \"12 Odd Future Songs\", \"Numbers (MellowHype album)\", \"Casey Veggies\", \"Doris (album)\", \"Earl (mixtape)\", \"House of Blues\", \"Bastard (Tyler, the Creator album)\", \"AllHipHop\", \"Wolf (Tyler, The Creator album)\", \"Dash Radio\", \"Chicago\", \"Frank Ocean\", \"Hodgy\", \"BlackenedWhite\", \"Bastard (Tyler, The Creator album)\", \"Goblin (album)\", \"Instagram\", \"Loiter Squad\", \"The Internet (band)\", \"The Odd Future Tape\", \"XL Recordings\", \"Golf Wang\", \"Mike G\", \"Pitchfork Media\", \"Syd (singer)\", \"The Jet Age of Tomorrow\", \"MellowHigh\", \"Eminem\", \"Hodgy Beats\", \"Jackass (TV series)\", \"The Alchemist (producer)\", \"Bastard (Tyler, the Creator mixtape)\", \"Pyramid Vritra\", \"Tyler, The Creator\", \"California\", \"Billboard 200\", \"Radical (mixtape)\", \"EarlWolf\", \"Fat Possum Records\"]}, {\"title\": \"Pitchfork\", \"link_id\": \"Pitchfork (website)\", \"summary\": \"Pitchfork is an American online magazine launched in 1995 by Ryan Schreiber, based in Chicago, Illinois and owned by Conde Nast.

Influenced by local fanzines and KUOM, Schreiber, who had no previous writing experience, aimed to provide the Internet with a regularly updated resource for independent music. At first being Turntable, the site was updated monthly with interviews and reviews. In May 1996, the site began publishing daily and was renamed Pitchfork, alluding to Tony Montana's tattoo in Scarface.In early 1999, Schreiber relocated Pitchfork to Chicago, Illinois. By then, the site had expanded to four full-length album reviews daily, as well as sporadic interviews, features, and columns. It had also begun garnering a following for its extensive coverage of underground music and its writing style, which was often unhindered by the conventions of journalism. In October, the site added a daily music news section.Pitchfork has launched a variety of subsidiary websites. Pitchfork.tv, a website displaying videos related to many independent music acts, launched in April 2008. It features bands that are typically found on Pitchfork . In July 2010, Pitchfork announced Altered Zones, a blog aggregator devoted to underground and do it yourself music. On 21 May 2011, Pitchfork announced a partnership with Kill Screen, in which Pitchfork would publish some of their articles. Altered Zones was closed on November 30. On December 26, 2012, Pitchfork launched Nothing Major, a website that covered visual arts such as fine art and photography. Nothing Major closed in October 2013. On October 13, 2015, Conde Nast announced that it had acquired Pitchfork. Following the sale, Schreiber remained as editor-in-chief.On March 13, 2016, Pitchfork was redesigned. According to an announcement post during the redesign, they said:\\n\\n\\n== Influence ==\\n\\n\\n=== Publicity and artist popularity ===\\nPitchfork's opinions have gained increased cultural currency; some in the mainstream media view the site as a barometer of the independent music scene, and positive quotes from its reviews are increasingly used in press releases and affixed to the front of CDs.\\nSome publications have cited Pitchfork in having played a part in \\\"breaking\\\" artists such as Arcade Fire, Sufjan Stevens, Clap Your Hands Say Yeah, Interpol, The Go! Team, Junior Boys, The Books, Broken Social Scene, Cold War Kids, Wolf Parade, Tapes 'n Tapes, and Titus Andronicus although the site's true impact on their popularity remains a source of frequent debate.\\nConversely, Pitchfork has also been seen as being a negative influence on some indie artists. As suggested in a Washington Post article in April 2006, Pitchfork's reviews can have a significant influence on an album's popularity, especially if it had only been available to a limited audience or had been released on an independent record label. A dismissive 0.0 review of former Dismemberment Plan frontman Travis Morrison's Travistan album led to a large sales drop and a virtual college radio blacklist. On the other hand, \\\"an endorsement from Pitchfork--which dispenses its approval one-tenth of a point at a time, up to a maximum of 10 points--is very valuable, indeed.\\\"Examples of Pitchfork's impact include:\\n\\nArcade Fire is among the bands most commonly cited to have benefited from a Pitchfork review. In a 2005 Chicago Tribune article, a Merge Records employee states, \\\"After the Pitchfork review, [Funeral] went out of print for about a week because we got so many orders for the record.\\\"\\nBon Iver was catapulted to mainstream and critical success after a 2007 Pitchfork review of the album For Emma, Forever Ago. Pitchfork was the only publication to have included the album on a 2007 end-of-the-year list, while over sixteen popular publications included the re-release on their 2008 lists. In the summer of 2011, Pitchfork noted Bon Iver's self titled release as \\\"Best New Music,\\\" and later chose the release as the Best Album of 2011. Pitchfork's critical acclamation of Bon Iver is widely seen as lifting the artist to commercial mainstream success, which culminated with his Grammy Award for Best New Artist and Best Alternative Music Album. Time Magazine nominated Bon Iver as Person of the Year in 2012, noting the 2007 Pitchfork review as the \\\"indie cred\\\" that \\\"led to mainstream success.\\\"\\nClap Your Hands Say Yeah member Lee Sargent has discussed the impact of Pitchfork's influence on their album, saying, \\\"The thing about a publication like Pitchfork is that they can decide when that happens. You know what I mean? They can say, 'We're going to speed up the process and this is going to happen...now!' And it was a kick in the pants for us, because we lost control of everything.\\\"\\n\\n\\n=== Size, readership and site traffic ===\\nPitchfork now receives an audience of more than 240,000 readers per day, and more than 1.5 million unique visitors per month, making it the most popular independent-focused music publication online. On October 24, 2003, the author of Pitchformula.com reported that Pitchfork had published 5,575 reviews from 158 different authors, with an average length of just over 520 words. Together, the reviews featured a total of 2,901,650 words.\\n\\n\\n== Criticism ==\\nOne common complaint is that the website's journalism suffers from a narrow view of independent music, favoring lo-fi and often obscure indie rock and giving only cursory treatment to other genres. Some critics have suggested that the site rates albums from particular music scenes or artists more favorably in order to bolster its influence when the music becomes popular.The majority of criticism, however, is aimed at the site's album reviewing style. Critics argue the site often emphasizes a reviewers' own writing over the actual music being reviewed, sometimes not even reviewing the album and instead criticising the artist's integrity. Pitchfork is also known to give \\\"0\\\" ratings, deeming the work, essentially and critically, worthless. This can be compared to the site giving unfeasibly high ratings to albums that have been universally panned elsewhere, such as Metal Machine Music by Lou Reed, which Pitchfork rated as 8.7/10. One critic wrote that the rating of a particular album amounts to no more than a \\\"cheap publicity stunt\\\" for a website that \\\"thrives on controversy.\\\" The critic also hypothetically asked how a neo-Nazi punk record would be scored in comparison to these \\\"0\\\" albums, based on Pitchfork standards.\\n\\n\\n=== Parodies ===\\nWhen Pitchfork asked comedian David Cross to compile a list of his favorite albums, he instead provided them with a list of \\\"Albums to Listen to While Reading Overwrought Pitchfork Reviews\\\". In it, he satirically piled over-the-top praise on fictional indie rock records, mocking Pitchfork's reviewing style.\\nIn 2004, comedy website Something Awful created a parody of Pitchfork's front page. Entitled \\\"RichDork Media\\\", the page makes reference to nonexistent, obscure-sounding indie-rock bands in its reviews, news headlines and advertisements. The rating system measures music on its proximity to the band Radiohead. A similar, more light-hearted parody was created by Sub Pop, a record label whose musical artists Pitchfork has reviewed (often favorably).\\nOn September 10, 2007, the satirical newspaper The Onion published a story in which founder Ryan Schreiber reviews music as a whole, giving it a 6.8.\\nIn 2010, writer David Shapiro started a Tumblr called \\\"Pitchfork Reviews Reviews,\\\" which reviews Pitchfork reviews.\\nIn 2016, in the RiffTrax comedy commentary for the film Icebreaker, Mike Nelson quipped about the ticking of a Geiger counter, \\\"This Geiger counter released an album of just this; Pitchfork gave it an 8.3.\\\"\\n\\n\\n=== Leaked music ===\\nIn August 2006, a directory on Pitchfork's servers containing over 300 albums was compromised. A web surfer managed to discover and download the collection, which included The Decemberists' The Crane Wife and TV on the Radio's Return to Cookie Mountain, both of which had been leaked to peer-to-peer networks. Allegedly, one of the albums on the server, Joanna Newsom's Ys, had not been available on file-sharing networks.\\n\\n\\n=== Deleted and changed reviews ===\\nPitchfork has been criticized for deleting older reviews from their archive in an effort to keep up with the changing trends in indie music. One such example is the 9.5/10 review written for ska band Save Ferris' album It Means Everything. Similarly, the original review of Psyence Fiction by Unkle received 9.8, but the review was later deleted and when the group released their next album four years later, the website gave it a score of 5 and described it as an improvement on their debut, calling Psyence Fiction \\\"one of the most anti-climactic and jaw-dropping disappointments of recent years\\\" which \\\"came up short on little things like, oh, vitality, restraint, emotional resonance, and tunes.\\\"Negative reviews of two By Divine Right albums were also removed from Pitchfork after members Brendan Canning and Leslie Feist became successful with the band Broken Social Scene and their own solo work. Steven Byrd's deleted review of By Divine Right's Bless This Mess, on which Canning and Feist play bass and guitar, went so far as to compare the band to \\\"retard(s) with a guitar\\\" who \\\"wouldn't know Rock and Roll if she broke into their house and beat up their children,\\\" rating the album 1.8. After Belle and Sebastian's \\\"comeback\\\" in the mid-to-late 2000s, Pitchfork removed their .8 review of The Boy with the Arab Strap from the site. The reviewer lambasted the band for writing songs that were \\\"so sticky they should be hanging from Ben Stiller's ear, and I don't mean that in a good way.\\\" Pitchfork originally gave the Flaming Lips album Zaireeka a scathing 0 in a review that also derided all Flaming Lips fans.Pitchfork has also removed the 9.4 review for the album Things Fall Apart by The Roots. They also removed the 1998 review of In the Aeroplane Over the Sea by Neutral Milk Hotel, which initially received an 8.7. Schreiber's review of the John Coltrane album Live! at the Village Vanguard was deleted after attaining notoriety for its supposedly poor writing and alleged racist stereotypes, particularly in the lines, \\\"It's like a dream I had: I floated on the River Nile, smokin' some fresh weed, relaxin'. But I ain't ever gonna see the Nile anyhow.\\\" Additionally, Schreiber's original 7.5 review of a reissue of The Beach Boys' Pet Sounds, which criticized the album for being dated and passe compared to more modern albums like OK Computer, was later removed.\\n\\n\\n=== Misinformation ===\\nPitchfork has been criticized directly by artists for misrepresentation, most famously in 2007 by the artist M.I.A. for what one of their writers later described as \\\"perpetuating the male-led ingenue myth\\\" with regard to her work. Some have argued this is not isolated to Pitchfork in the music press, while this incident was later cited and similarly condemned by the artist Bjork, who criticized the site for assuming female musicians do not usually write or produce their own music. Pitchfork's articles on M.I.A. and her career since the incident have been noticeably negative and have attracted media commentary;  an article titled \\\"M.I.A. Uses Pitchfork Tweets to Diss Pitchfork\\\" was printed by LA Weekly in 2010.\\n\\n\\n== The Pitchfork Review ==\\n\\nIn December 2013, Pitchfork Media debuted The Pitchfork Review, a quarterly print journal focused on long-form music writing and design-focused content. J.C. Gabel, its first editor, had been the publisher of The Chicagoan and founding publisher of Stop Smiling. Pitchfork planned a limited-edition quarterly publication of about 10,000 copies of each issue, perfect bound, and printed on glossy, high-quality 8-by-10 1/4  paper. It was expected that about two-thirds of the content would be original, with the remaining one-third recycled from the Pitchfork website. The International Business Times likened the publication's literary aspirations to The New Yorker and Paris Review.\\n\\n\\n== Music festivals ==\\n\\n\\n=== Intonation Music Festival ===\\n\\nIn 2005, Pitchfork curated the Intonation Music Festival, attracting approximately 15,000 attendees to Chicago's Union Park for a two-day bill featuring performances by 25 acts, including Broken Social Scene, The Decemberists, The Go! Team, and an appearance by Les Savy Fav.\\n\\n\\n=== Pitchfork Music Festival ===\\n\\nOn July 29 and 30, 2006, the publication premiered its own Pitchfork Music Festival in the same park. The event attracted over 18,000 attendees per day. More than 40 bands performed at the inaugural festival, including Spoon and Yo La Tengo, as well as a rare headlining set by reunited Tropicalia band Os Mutantes.The Pitchfork Music Festival was held again in 2007. It was expanded to three days (Friday, July 13 - Sunday, July 15), with the first day being a collaboration between Pitchfork and the British music festival All Tomorrow's Parties as part of the latter's \\\"Don't Look Back\\\" series, in which seminal artists perform their most legendary albums in their entirety. Performers that evening included Sonic Youth playing Daydream Nation, Slint playing Spiderland, and GZA/Genius playing Liquid Swords. Some of the other artists who performed over the weekend included Yoko Ono, De La Soul, Cat Power, The New Pornographers, Stephen Malkmus, Clipse, Iron & Wine, Girl Talk, Of Montreal, Deerhunter, Dan Deacon, The Ponys, and The Sea and Cake. Since 2011, a European winter edition of the festival takes place in Paris.\\n\\n\\n=== All Tomorrow's Parties ===\\nIn 2008 Pitchfork collaborated with All Tomorrow's Parties to curate half of the bill for one of their May festival weekends. This was the first event that Pitchfork has been involved in outside of the United States.\\n\\n\\n== Rating system ==\\nPitchfork's music reviews use two different rating systems:\\n\\nIndividual track reviews were formerly ranked from 1 to 5 stars, but on January 15, 2007, the site introduced a new system called \\\"Forkcast\\\". In it, instead of assigning tracks a particular rating, reviewers simply label them one of the following categories: \\\"New Music\\\", \\\"Old Music\\\", \\\"Video\\\", \\\"Advanced Music\\\", \\\"Rising\\\", \\\"WTF\\\", \\\"On Repeat\\\" (the category of their most favorably regarded songs), and \\\"Delete\\\" (for the least favored songs). As of  2009, the site had officially removed this system, opting to instead simply review tracks, while giving some a label of \\\"Best New Track\\\".\\nAlbum reviews are given a rating out of 10, specific to one decimal point.On October 24, 2003, Pitchformula.com made a survey of the 5,575 reviews available on Pitchfork at that time, showing that:\\n\\n6.7 was the average rating\\n2,339 reviews had been awarded a rating of 7.4 or higher\\n2,362 reviews had been awarded a rating of between 5.0 and 7.3\\n873 reviews had been awarded a rating of less than 5.0British Sea Power's 2008 album Do You Like Rock Music? was initially awarded a tongue-in-cheek rating of \\\"U.2\\\", however the page now gives a rating of 8.2, seemingly at odds with the critical review. Their rating of Run the Jewels' remix album Meow the Jewels (2015) was a pictogram of a cat's head with hearts for eyes - highlighting the pictogram and right-clicking on it reveals that the actual score is 7.0. Their review of Pope Francis' album Wake Up! featured the rating \\\"3:16,\\\" though using the same method of revealing Meow the Jewels' actual score reveals the score to be 5.0. Rather than give a proper review to Jet's Shine On, the site simply posted an embedded video of a monkey urinating into its own mouth and a 0.\\n\\n\\n=== Initial release 10.0 rated albums ===\\nThe following is a list of albums given Pitchfork's highest possible rating, on initial release. The score is rare and has only been given to eleven albums since the site was launched in 1995. Many more albums have been given a 10 on re-release. Note that Pitchfork has since deleted the reviews for 12 Rods, Amon Tobin, Walt Mink, The Flaming Lips, and Bob Dylan without replacing them with newer reviews, effectively reducing the canon of albums that Pitchfork still considers to be worthy of a 10.0 on initial release to six albums.\\nRelaxation of the Asshole, a comedy album by Guided by Voices singer Robert Pollard, was awarded a dual 0 and 10 on initial release. A later site redesign changed the rating to 0 only, although the explanation for the unusual rating remains in the text of the review.\\n\\n\\n== Pitchfork awards ==\\n\\n\\n=== Pitchfork Album of the Year ===\\n\\n\\n=== Pitchfork Track of the Year ===\\n\\n\\n=== Pitchfork Video of the Year ===\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nThe Pitchfork 500\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nOfficial website\", \"rev_id\": 855785391, \"accessed\": \"2018-09-03 00:23:59.864295\", \"links\": [\"Tapes 'n Tapes\", \"Broken Social Scene\", \"Stephen Malkmus\", \"Zaireeka\", \"The Ponys\", \"Tony Montana\", \"Yo La Tengo\", \"France\", \"Arcade Fire\", \"Nile\", \"Minneapolis\", \"The Pitchfork Review\", \"Stop Smiling\", \"The New Pornographers\", \"OK Computer\", \"Things Fall Apart (album)\", \"Girl Talk (musician)\", \"Chicago\", \"Ys (Joanna Newsom album)\", \"The Decemberists\", \"Metal Machine Music\", \"Save Ferris\", \"Bon Iver (album)\", \"Clap Your Hands Say Yeah\", \"Slint\", \"Pet Sounds\", \"Intonation Music Festival\", \"Cookie (magazine)\", \"Titus Andronicus (band)\", \"The Beach Boys\", \"Bob Dylan\", \"Relaxation of the Asshole\", \"Scarface (1983 film)\", \"Junior Boys\", \"Pope Francis\", \"Chicago Tribune\", \"Jet (band)\", \"Illinois\", \"Walt Mink\", \"Os Mutantes\", \"The Onion\", \"John Coltrane\", \"Les Savy Fav\", \"Deerhunter\", \"Ben Stiller\", \"TV on the Radio\", \"Interpol (band)\", \"W (magazine)\", \"The Books\", \"Amon Tobin\", \"The Chicagoan\", \"Radiohead\", \"De La Soul\", \"Brendan Canning\", \"The Go!

His mother nearly died during her 73-hour labor with him. Eminem's parents were in a band called Daddy Warbucks, playing in Ramada Inns along the Dakotas-Montana border before their separation. Bruce left the family, moving to California and having two other children: Michael and Sarah. Debbie later had son Nathan \\\"Nate\\\" Kane Samara. During his childhood, Eminem and Debbie shuttled between Michigan and Missouri, rarely staying in one house for more than a year or two and living primarily with family members. In Missouri, they lived in several places, including St. Joseph, Savannah, and Kansas City.As a teenager, Eminem wrote letters to his father; according to Debbie, all came back marked \\\"return to sender\\\". Friends and family remember Eminem as a happy child, but \\\"a bit of a loner\\\" who was often bullied. One bully, De'Angelo Bailey, severely injured Eminem's head (mentioned in his song \\\"Brain Damage\\\"); Debbie filed a lawsuit against the school in 1982, which was dismissed the following year because the Macomb County (Mich.) judge said the schools were immune from lawsuits. Eminem spent much of his youth in a working-class, primarily black, Detroit neighborhood. He and Debbie were one of three white households on their block, and Eminem was beaten by black youths several times. As a child he was interested in storytelling, aspiring to be a comic-book artist before discovering hip hop. Eminem heard his first rap song (\\\"Reckless\\\", featuring Ice-T) on the Breakin' soundtrack, a gift from Debbie's half-brother Ronnie Polkinghorn, who was close to him and later became a musical mentor to him. When Polkinghorn committed suicide in 1991, Eminem stopped speaking for days and did not attend his funeral.Eminem's home life was seldom stable; he frequently fought with his mother, whom a social worker described as having a \\\"very suspicious, almost paranoid personality\\\". When her son became famous, Debbie was unimpressed by suggestions that she was a less-than-ideal mother, contending that she sheltered him and was responsible for his success. In 1987, Debbie allowed runaway Kimberly Ann \\\"Kim\\\" Scott to stay at their home; several years later, Eminem began an on-and-off relationship with Scott. After spending three years in ninth grade due to truancy and poor grades, he dropped out of Lincoln High School at age 17. Although he was interested in English, he never explored literature (preferring comic books) and disliked math and social studies. Eminem worked at several jobs to help his mother pay the bills, later maintaining that she often threw him out of the house anyway. When she left to play bingo, he would blast the stereo and write songs.At age 14, Eminem began rapping with high-school friend Mike Ruby; they adopted the names \\\"Manix\\\" and \\\"M&M\\\", the latter of which evolved into \\\"Eminem\\\". Eminem sneaked into neighboring Osborn High School with friend and fellow rapper Proof for lunchroom freestyle rap battles. On Saturdays, they attended open mic contests at the Hip-Hop Shop on West 7 Mile, considered \\\"ground zero\\\" for the Detroit rap scene. Struggling to succeed in a predominantly black industry, Eminem was appreciated by underground hip hop audiences. When he wrote verses, he wanted most of the words to rhyme; he wrote long words or phrases on paper and, underneath, worked on rhymes for each syllable. Although the words often made little sense, the drill helped Eminem practice sounds and rhymes.\\n\\n\\n=== 1992-1997: Early career, Infinite and family struggles ===\\n\\nAs Eminem's reputation grew, he was recruited by several rap groups; the first was the New Jacks. After they disbanded he joined Soul Intent, who released a single on their 1995 self-titled EP featuring Proof. Eminem and Proof then teamed up with four other rappers to form The Dirty Dozen (D12), who released their first album Devil's Night in 2001. Eminem had his first run-in with the law at age 20, when he was arrested for his involvement in a drive-by shooting with a paintball gun. The case was dismissed when the victim did not appear in court.Eminem was soon signed to Jeff and Mark Bass's FBT Productions, and recorded his debut album Infinite for their independent Web Entertainment label. The album was a commercial failure upon its release in 1996. One lyrical subject of Infinite was his struggle to raise his newborn daughter, Hailie Jade Scott Mathers, on little money. During this period, Eminem's rhyming style, primarily inspired by rappers Nas, Esham and AZ, lacked the comically violent slant for which he later became known. Detroit disc jockeys largely ignored Infinite, and the feedback Eminem did receive (\\\"Why don't you go into rock and roll?\\\") led him to craft angrier, moodier tracks. At this time Eminem and Kim Scott lived in a crime-ridden neighborhood, and their house was robbed several times. Eminem cooked and washed dishes for minimum wage at Gilbert's Lodge, a family-style restaurant at St. Clair Shores. His former boss described him as becoming a model employee, as he worked 60 hours a week for six months after Hailie's birth. He was fired shortly before Christmas, and later said, \\\"It was, like, five days before Christmas, which is Hailie's birthday. I had, like, forty dollars to get her something.\\\" After the release of Infinite, his personal problems and substance abuse culminated in a suicide attempt. By March 1997 he was fired from Gilbert's Lodge for the last time, and lived in his mother's mobile home with Kim and Hailie.\\n\\n\\n=== 1998-1999: Introduction to Slim Shady, The Slim Shady LP and rise to success ===\\nEminem attracted more attention when he developed Slim Shady, a sadistic, violent alter ego. The character allowed him to express his anger with lyrics about drugs, rape, and murder. In the spring of 1997 he recorded his debut EP, the Slim Shady EP, which was released that winter by Web Entertainment. The EP, with frequent references to drug use, sexual acts, mental instability and violence, also explored the more-serious themes of dealing with poverty and marital and family difficulties and revealed his direct, self-deprecating response to criticism. Hip-hop magazine The Source featured Eminem in its \\\"Unsigned Hype\\\" column in March 1998.\\n\\nAfter he was evicted from his home, Eminem went to Los Angeles to compete in the 1997 Rap Olympics, an annual, nationwide battle rap competition. He placed second, and Interscope Records staff in attendance sent a copy of the Slim Shady EP to company CEO Jimmy Iovine. Iovine played the tape for record producer Dr. Dre, founder of Aftermath Entertainment and founding member of hip-hop group N.W.A. Dre recalled, \\\"In my entire career in the music industry, I have never found anything from a demo tape or a CD. When Jimmy played this, I said, 'Find him. Now.'\\\",and on the fourth & the last episode of The Defiant Ones Dre said, \\\"i was like: what the fuck!?, and who the fuck is that?\\\" expressing his shock towards Mathers' rapping talent, Although his associates criticized him for hiring a white rapper, he was confident in his decision: \\\"I don't give a fuck if you're purple; if you can kick it, I'm working with you.\\\" Eminem had idolized Dre since listening to N.W.A. as a teenager, and was nervous about working with him on an album: \\\"I didn't want to be starstruck or kiss his ass too much ... I'm just a little white boy from Detroit. I had never seen stars, let alone Dr. Dre.\\\" He became more comfortable working with Dre after a series of productive recording sessions.Eminem released The Slim Shady LP in February 1999. Although it was one of the year's most popular albums (certified triple platinum by the end of the year), he was accused of imitating the style and subject matter of underground rapper Cage. The album's popularity was accompanied by controversy over its lyrics; in \\\"'97 Bonnie and Clyde\\\" Eminem describes a trip with his infant daughter when he disposes of his wife's body, and in \\\"Guilty Conscience\\\" which encourages a man to murder his wife and her lover. \\\"Guilty Conscience\\\" marked the beginning of a friendship and musical bond between Dr. Dre and Eminem. The label-mates later collaborated on a number of hit songs (\\\"Forgot About Dre\\\" and \\\"What's the Difference\\\" while also providing uncredited vocals on \\\"The Watcher\\\"\\\" from Dr. Dre's album 2001, \\\"Bitch Please II\\\" from The Marshall Mathers LP, \\\"Say What You Say\\\" from The Eminem Show, \\\"Encore/Curtains Down\\\" from Encore, and \\\"Old Time's Sake\\\" and \\\"Crack a Bottle\\\" from Relapse), and Dre made at least one guest appearance on each of Eminem's Aftermath albums. The Slim Shady LP has been certified quadruple platinum by the RIAA.\\n\\n\\n=== 2000-2002: The Marshall Mathers LP, lyrical conflicts and The Eminem Show ===\\n\\nThe Marshall Mathers LP was released in May 2000. It sold 1,760,000 copies in its first week, breaking US records held by Snoop Dogg's Doggystyle for fastest-selling hip hop album and Britney Spears' ...Baby One More Time for fastest-selling solo album. The first single from the album, \\\"The Real Slim Shady\\\", was a success despite controversies about Eminem's insults and dubious claims about celebrities (for example, that Christina Aguilera had performed oral sex on Fred Durst and Carson Daly). In his second single, \\\"The Way I Am\\\", he reveals the pressure from his record company to top \\\"My Name Is\\\". Although Eminem parodied shock rocker Marilyn Manson in the music video for \\\"My Name Is\\\", they are reportedly on good terms; Manson is mentioned in \\\"The Way I Am\\\", appeared in its music video and has performed a live remix of the song with Eminem. In the third single, \\\"Stan\\\" (which samples Dido's \\\"Thank You\\\"), Eminem tries to deal with his new fame, assuming the persona of a deranged fan who kills himself and his pregnant girlfriend (mirroring \\\"'97 Bonnie & Clyde\\\" from The Slim Shady LP). Q called \\\"Stan\\\" the third-greatest rap song of all time, and it was ranked tenth in a Top40-Charts.com survey. The song has since been ranked 296th on Rolling Stone's \\\"500 Greatest Songs of All Time\\\" list. In July 2000, Eminem was the first white artist to appear on the cover of The Source. The Marshall Mathers LP was certified Diamond by the RIAA in March 2011 and sold 32 million copies worldwide.Eminem performed with Elton John at the 43rd Grammy Awards ceremony in 2001, with the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD, an organization which considered Eminem's lyrics homophobic) condemning John's decision to perform with Eminem. Entertainment Weekly placed the appearance on its end-of-decade \\\"best-of\\\" list: \\\"It was the hug heard 'round the world. Eminem, under fire for homophobic lyrics, shared the stage with a gay icon for a performance of \\\"Stan\\\" that would have been memorable in any context.\\\" On February 21, the day of the awards ceremony, GLAAD held a protest outside the Staples Center (the ceremony's venue). In 2001 Eminem appeared in the Up in Smoke Tour with rappers Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Xzibit and Ice Cube and the Family Values Tour with Limp Bizkit, headlining the Anger Management Tour with Papa Roach, Ludacris and Xzibit.\\nThe Eminem Show was released in May 2002. It was another success, reaching number one on the charts and selling over 1.332 million copies during its first full week. The album's single, \\\"Without Me\\\", denigrates boy bands, Limp Bizkit, Dick and Lynne Cheney, Moby and others. The Eminem Show certified Diamond by the RIAA examines the effects of Eminem's rise to fame, his relationship with his wife and daughter and his status in the hip-hop community, addressing an assault charge brought by a bouncer he saw kissing his wife in 2000. Although several tracks are clearly angry, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic found The Eminem Show less inflammatory than The Marshall Mathers LP. L. Brent Bozell III, who had criticized The Marshall Mathers LP for misogynistic lyrics, noted The Eminem Show's extensive use of obscenity and called Eminem \\\"Eminef\\\" for the prevalence of the word \\\"motherfucker\\\" on the album. The Eminem Show sold 30 million copies worldwide and was the best-selling album of 2002.\\n\\n\\n=== 2003-2007: Encore, more lyrical conflicts and musical hiatus ===\\n\\nOn December 8, 2003, the United States Secret Service said that it was \\\"looking into\\\" allegations that Eminem had threatened the President of the United States. The cause for concern was the lyrics of \\\"We As Americans\\\" (\\\"Fuck money / I don't rap for dead presidents / I'd rather see the president dead / It's never been said, but I set precedents\\\"), which was later released on a bonus CD with the deluxe edition of Encore.Also in 2003 Eminem, a lifelong fan of Tupac, provided production work for three tracks on the Tupac Resurrection soundtrack  He would follow this up the next year by producing 12 of the 16 tracks on Tupac's Loyal to the Game album.Encore, released in 2004, was another success. Its sales were partially driven by the first single, \\\"Just Lose It\\\", which contained slurs about Michael Jackson. On October 12, 2004, a week after the release of \\\"Just Lose It\\\", Jackson phoned the Los Angeles-based Steve Harvey radio show to report his displeasure with its video (which parodies Jackson's child molestation trial, plastic surgery and the 1984 incident when Jackson's hair caught fire during the filming of a commercial). In the song Eminem says, \\\"That's not a stab at Michael / That's just a metaphor / I'm just psycho\\\". Many of Jackson's friends and supporters spoke out against the video, including Stevie Wonder (who described it as \\\"kicking a man while he's down\\\" and \\\"bullshit\\\") and Steve Harvey (who said, \\\"Eminem has lost his ghetto pass. We want the pass back\\\"). The video also parodied Pee-wee Herman, MC Hammer and Madonna during her Blond Ambition period. \\\"Weird Al\\\" Yankovic, who parodied the Eminem song \\\"Lose Yourself\\\" on \\\"Couch Potato\\\" for his 2003 album Poodle Hat, told the Chicago Sun-Times about Jackson's protest: \\\"Last year, Eminem forced me to halt production on the video for my 'Lose Yourself' parody because he somehow thought that it would be harmful to his image or career. So the irony of this situation with Michael is not lost on me.\\\" Although Black Entertainment Television stopped playing the video, MTV announced that it would continue to air it. The Source, through CEO Raymond \\\"Benzino\\\" Scott, called for the video to be pulled, the song removed from the album and Eminem to apologize publicly to Jackson. In 2007 Jackson and Sony bought Famous Music from Viacom, giving him the rights to songs by Eminem, Shakira, Beck and others.Despite its lead single's humorous theme, Encore explored serious subject matter with the anti-war song \\\"Mosh\\\". The song criticized President George W. Bush as \\\"This weapon of mass destruction that we call our president\\\", with lyrics including \\\"Fuck Bush\\\". On October 25, 2004, a week before the 2004 US Presidential election, Eminem released the video for \\\"Mosh\\\" on the Internet. In it, Eminem gathers an army (including rapper Lloyd Banks) of Bush-administration victims and leads them to the White House. When they break in, it is learned that they are there to register to vote; the video ends with \\\"VOTE Tuesday November 2\\\". After Bush's reelection, the video's ending was changed to Eminem and the protesters invading the White House during a speech by the president. Also in 2004 Eminem launched a satellite music channel, Shade 45, on Sirius radio, which was described by his manager as \\\"essentially a destination to get and hear things that other people aren't playing,\\\" In 2005, industry insiders speculated that Eminem was considering ending his rapping career after six years and several Multi-Platinum albums. Rumors began early in the year about a double album to be released late that year, entitled The Funeral; the greatest hits album, entitled Curtain Call: The Hits, was released in December. In July the Detroit Free Press reported a possible final bow for Eminem as a solo performer, quoting members of his inner circle as saying that he would embrace the roles of producer and label executive. The day of Curtain Call: The Hits's release, Eminem appeared on WKQI's \\\"Mojo in the Morning\\\" show. Denying that he was retiring, he suggested he would take a break as an artist: \\\"I'm at a point in my life right now where I feel like I don't know where my career is going ... This is the reason that we called it 'Curtain Call', because this could be the final thing. We don't know.\\\" The following year, Eminem released Eminem Presents: The Re-Up on Shady Records.\\nIn 2005, Eminem was ranked 58th in Bernard Goldberg's book, 100 People Who Are Screwing Up America. Goldberg cited a 2001 column by Bob Herbert of The New York Times, in which Herbert wrote \\\"In Eminem's world, all women are whores and he is eager to rape and murder them\\\", and the song \\\"No One's Iller\\\" from the Slim Shady EP as examples of Eminem's misogyny. That summer Eminem began his first US concert tour in three years, with the Anger Management 3 Tour featuring 50 Cent, G-Unit, Lil Jon, D12, Obie Trice and The Alchemist. In August he canceled the European leg of the tour, later announcing that he had entered drug rehabilitation for treatment of a \\\"dependency on sleep medication\\\". Curtain Call: The Hits was released December 6, 2005 by Aftermath Entertainment. During its first week it sold nearly 441,000 copies in the US, and was Eminem's fourth consecutive number-one album on the Billboard Hot 200. The album has been certified double platinum by the RIAA.In September 2007, Eminem called New York radio station WQHT during an interview with 50 Cent, saying that he was \\\"in limbo\\\" and \\\"debating\\\" about when (or if) he would release another album: \\\"I'm always working - I'm always in the studio. It feels good right now, the energy of the label. For a while, I didn't want to go back to the studio ... I went through some personal things. I'm coming out of those personal things [and] it feels good.\\\"\\n\\n\\n=== 2008-2009: Comeback, Relapse and Refill ===\\n\\nEminem appeared on his Shade 45 Sirius channel in September 2008, saying: \\\"Right now I'm kinda just concentrating on my own stuff, for right now and just banging out tracks and producing a lot of stuff. You know, the more I keep producing the better it seems like I get 'cause I just start knowing stuff.\\\" Interscope confirmed that a new album would be released in spring 2009. In December 2008, Eminem provided more details about the album, entitled Relapse: \\\"Me and Dre are back in the lab like the old days, man. Dre will end up producing the majority of the tracks on 'Relapse'. We are up to our old mischievous ways ... let's just leave it at that.\\\"According to a March 5, 2009 press release, Eminem would release two new albums that year. Relapse, the first, was released on May 19; its first single and music video, \\\"We Made You\\\", had been released on April 7. Although Relapse did not sell as well as Eminem's previous albums and received mixed reviews, it was a commercial success and re-established his presence in the hip-hop world. It sold more than five million copies worldwide. During the 2009 MTV Movie Awards, Sacha Baron Cohen descended on the audience in an angel costume. He landed buttocks-first on Eminem, who stormed out of the ceremony; three days later, Eminem said that the stunt had been staged. On October 30 he headlined at the Voodoo Experience in New Orleans, his first full performance of the year. Eminem's act included several songs from Relapse, many of his older hits and an appearance by D12. On November 19, he announced on his website that Relapse: Refill would be released on December 21. The album was a re-release of Relapse with seven bonus tracks, including \\\"Forever\\\" and \\\"Taking My Ball\\\". Eminem described the CD:\\n\\nI want to deliver more material for the fans this year like I originally planned ... Hopefully these tracks on The Refill will tide the fans over until we put out Relapse 2 next year ... I got back in with Dre and then a few more producers, including Just Blaze, and went in a completely different direction which made me start from scratch. The new tracks started to sound very different than the tracks I originally intended to be on Relapse 2, but I still want the other stuff to be heard.\\n\\n\\n=== 2010-2011: Recovery and Bad Meets Evil reunion ===\\nOn April 14, 2010, Eminem tweeted: \\\"There is no Relapse 2\\\". Although his followers thought he was not releasing an album, he had changed its title to Recovery and confirmed this by tweeting \\\"RECOVERY\\\" with a link to his website. He said: \\n\\nI had originally planned for Relapse 2 to come out last year. But as I kept recording and working with new producers, the idea of a sequel to Relapse started to make less and less sense to me, and I wanted to make a completely new album. The music on Recovery came out very different from Relapse, and I think it deserves its own title. His seventh album was released on June 18. In the US Recovery sold 741,000 copies during its first week, topping the Billboard 200 chart. Eminem's sixth consecutive US number-one album also topped the charts in several other countries. Recovery remained atop the Billboard 200 chart for five consecutive weeks of a seven-week total.Billboard reported that it was the bestselling album of 2010, making Eminem the first artist in Nielsen SoundScan history with two year-end bestselling albums. Recovery is the bestselling digital album in history. Its first single, \\\"Not Afraid\\\", was released on April 29 and debuted atop the Billboard Hot 100; its music video was released on June 4. \\\"Not Afraid\\\" was followed by \\\"Love the Way You Lie\\\", which debuted at number two before rising to the top. Although \\\"Love the Way You Lie\\\" was the bestselling 2010 single in the United Kingdom, it did not reach number one (the first time this has happened in the UK since 1969). Despite criticism of its inconsistency, Recovery received positive reviews from most critics. As of  November 21, 2010, the album had US sales of three million copies. Recovery was the bestselling album worldwide in 2010, joining 2002's bestseller The Eminem Show to give Eminem two worldwide year-end number-one albums. With Recovery, Eminem broke the record for the most successive US number-one albums by a solo artist.\\n\\nHe appeared at the 2010 BET Awards, performing \\\"Not Afraid\\\" and \\\"Airplanes, Part II\\\" with B.o.B and Keyshia Cole. Later that year, he performed at the Activison E3 concert. In June Eminem and Jay-Z announced they would perform together in Detroit and New York, at concerts called The Home & Home Tour. The first two concerts quickly sold out, prompting an additional show in each city. BET called Eminem the number-one rapper of the 21st century. He opened the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards on September 12, performing \\\"Not Afraid\\\" and \\\"Love the Way You Lie\\\" with Rihanna singing the choruses. Due to the success of Recovery and the Home & Home Tour, Eminem was named the 2010 Hottest MC in the Game by MTV and Emcee of the Year by the online magazine HipHopDX. He and Rihanna again collaborated on \\\"Love the Way You Lie (Part II)\\\", the sequel of their hit single. Unlike the original, Rihanna is the lead vocalist and it is sung from the female perspective. In December 2010, the \\\"Great Eminem Recovery\\\" was number one on Billboard's Top 25 Music Moments of 2010. He appeared at the 2011 Grammy Awards on February 13, performing \\\"Love the Way You Lie (Part II)\\\" with Rihanna and Adam Levine and \\\"I Need a Doctor\\\" with Dr. Dre and Skylar Grey. That month it was announced that \\\"Space Bound\\\" would be the fourth single from Recovery, with a music video featuring former porn star Sasha Grey; the video was released June 24 on the iTunes Store.In 2010, Eminem again began collaborating with Royce da 5'9\\\" on their first EP as Bad Meets Evil; the duo formed in 1999. The EP, Hell: The Sequel, was released on June 14, 2011. Eminem was featured on Royce da 5'9\\\"'s \\\"Writer's Block\\\", released on April 8, 2011. On May 3 they released the lead single \\\"Fast Lane\\\" from their upcoming EP, and a music video was filmed. In March 2011, within days of each other, The Eminem Show and The Marshall Mathers LP were certified diamond by the RIAA; Eminem is the only rapper with two diamond-certified albums. With more than 60 million \\\"likes\\\" he was the most-followed person on Facebook, outscoring Lady Gaga, Justin Bieber, Rihanna and Michael Jackson. Eminem was the first artist in five years with two number-one albums (Recovery and Hell: The Sequel) in a 12-month period. Early in 2011 he leaked \\\"2.0 Boys\\\", on which Yelawolf and Slaughterhouse collaborated when they signed with Shady Records in January, and performed it in April. Bad Meets Evil released their next single, \\\"Lighters\\\", on July 6 and its music video in late August. On August 6, Eminem performed several songs from throughout his career at Lollapalooza with the artists who had been featured on each song.\\n\\n\\n=== 2012-2013: The Marshall Mathers LP 2 ===\\nEminem announced on May 24, 2012, that he was working on his next album, scheduled for release the following year. Without a title or release date, it was included on a number of \\\"Most Anticipated Albums of 2013\\\" lists (including MTV); Complex ranked it sixth, and XXL fifth.On August 14 \\\"Survival\\\", featuring Liz Rodrigues and produced by DJ Khalil, premiered in the multi-player trailer for the video game Call of Duty: Ghosts. According to a press release, the first single from Eminem's eighth album would be released soon. During the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards, it was announced that the album would be entitled The Marshall Mathers LP 2 (following The Marshall Mathers LP) and was scheduled for release on November 5.\\n\\nIts lead single, \\\"Berzerk\\\", was released on August 25 and debuted at number three on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Three more singles followed: \\\"Survival\\\" (appearing on the Call of Duty: Ghosts trailer), \\\"Rap God\\\" and \\\"The Monster\\\" (with Rihanna).\\nThe album was released on November 5, by Aftermath Entertainment, Shady Records and Interscope Records. Its standard version had 16 tracks, and the deluxe version included a second disc with five additional tracks. The Marshall Mathers LP 2 was Eminem's seventh album to debut atop the Billboard 200, and had the year's second-largest first-week sales. He was the first artist since the Beatles to have four singles in the top 20 of the Billboard Hot 100.In the United Kingdom The Marshall Mathers LP 2 debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart. The first American artist with seven consecutive UK number-one albums, he is tied with The Beatles for second place for the most consecutive chart-topping UK albums. The album secured Eminem's position as Canada's best-selling artist, and was 2013's best-selling album.On November 3, Eminem was named the first YouTube Music Awards Artist of the Year, and a week later he received the Global Icon Award at the 2013 MTV EMA Music Awards. On June 10, it was announced that Eminem was the first artist to receive two digital diamond certifications - sales and streams of 10 million and above - by the RIAA (for \\\"Not Afraid\\\" and \\\"Love the Way You Lie\\\"). On July 11 and 12, Eminem played two concerts in Wembley Stadium. At the 57th Grammy Awards, he received Best Rap Album award for The Marshall Mathers LP 2 and Best Rap/Sung Collaboration (with Rihanna) for \\\"The Monster\\\".\\n\\n\\n=== 2014-2016: Shady XV, vinyl box set, and Southpaw ===\\n\\nIn the summer of 2014, Eminem and Rosenberg began using the hashtag #SHADYXV on social networking sites, and Eminem  wore a T-shirt with the hashtag onstage. This was later revealed to be the name of an upcoming Shady Records compilation. Shortly afterwards the first single from the album (\\\"Guts Over Fear\\\", featuring singer-songwriter Sia Furler) was released and the album's track list was released on October 29. Shady Records released a cypher to promote the album, in which Eminem did a seven-minute freestyle. \\\"Detroit Vs. Everybody\\\" (the album's second single), with Eminem, Dej Loaf, Royce da 5'9\\\", Danny Brown, Big Sean and Trick-Trick, was released on November 11. Shady XV, released on November 24 during Black Friday week, consists of one greatest-hits disc and one disc of new material by Shady Records artists such as D12, Slaughterhouse, Bad Meets Evil and Yelawolf. The album debuted at number three on the Billboard 200 chart, with first-week sales of 138,000 copies in the United States.The Official Eminem Box Set, a career-spanning, 10-disc vinyl box set, was released on March 12, 2015. The set includes seven of Eminem's eight studio albums (excluding Infinite), the 8 Mile soundtrack, the compilation Eminem Presents: The Re-Up, and the greatest hits collection Curtain Call: The Hits. Early in the year, it was announced that he would appear on Tech N9ne's \\\"Speedom (Worldwide Choppers 2)\\\". The song, also featuring Krizz Kaliko, was released on April 20. Eminem also appeared on Yelawolf's \\\"Best Friend\\\", the single from Love Story.\\nEminem is the executive producer of the soundtrack on the sports drama Southpaw, with Shady Records. The first single from the soundtrack called 'Phenomenal' was released on June 2, 2015. Another single, \\\"Kings Never Die\\\" by Eminem featuring Gwen Stefani, was released on July 10, 2015 on YouTube via Eminem's Vevo account. Eminem was the first interview of Zane Lowe in Beats 1. The interview streamed online on the Beats 1 radio on  July 1, 2015.\\nEminem appeared on the public access show Only in Monroe, produced in Monroe, Michigan, and was interviewed by guest host Stephen Colbert for an episode that aired July 1, 2015. In the episode Eminem sang snippets of Bob Seger songs at Colbert's prompting and briefly discussed Southpaw. In June 2015, it was revealed that he will serve as the executive producer and music supervisor on the TV series Motor City whose premise will be based upon the 2002 film Narc.\\n\\nIn September 2016, Eminem was featured on Skylar Grey's song, \\\"Kill For You\\\", which appears on her album, Natural Causes. On October 19, 2016, Eminem released a new song called \\\"Campaign Speech\\\", a political hip hop song, and announced he was working on a new album. On November 17, 2016, Eminem released a remastered version of 'Infinite' on his YouTube VEVO channel. On November 22, 2016, Eminem released a trailer for a 10-minute short documentary called Partners in Rhyme: The True Story of Infinite.\\n\\n\\n=== 2017-present: Revival and Kamikaze ===\\n\\nIn February 2017, Eminem appeared on \\\"No Favors\\\", a track from Big Sean's album I Decided. In the song, Eminem calls the newly elected President Donald Trump a \\\"bitch\\\", and also raps about raping conservative social and political commentator Ann Coulter, who is a Trump supporter, with a variety of foreign objects. Coulter responded to the lyrics, stating, \\\"I think it's unfortunate that the left, from Berkeley to Eminem with his rap songs, has normalized violence against women, as Eminem has done.\\\"  Eminem participated in the 2017 BET Hip Hop Awards' annual cypher, using his verse, a freestyle rap called \\\"The Storm\\\", to further criticize Trump and the administration for, among other things, Trump's focus on National Football League players' protests during \\\"The Star Spangled Banner\\\" over Hurricane Maria recovery efforts and lack of gun control reform in the wake of the 2017 Las Vegas shooting. Eminem ended the cypher by giving an ultimatum saying that Trump supporters cannot be his fans. The verse received wide praise among other rappers following its release. In October 2017, Eminem appeared on \\\"Revenge\\\", a track from Pink's album Beautiful Trauma.Starting in late October, Eminem and Paul Rosenberg began teasing what fans speculated was the title of a new album titled Revival, in the form of advertisements for a fake medication of the same name. Later in November, the first single \\\"Walk on Water\\\" was released, which featured Beyonce. The song was first performed, by Eminem, at the 2017 MTV Europe Music Awards on November 12, featuring Skylar Grey. He appeared on Saturday Night Live on November 18, performing \\\"Walk on Water\\\", \\\"Stan\\\" and \\\"Love the Way You Lie\\\" with Skylar Grey. On November 28, Dr. Dre posted a video confirming the album's release date as December 15, 2017. On December 8, Eminem released a promotional single titled \\\"Untouchable\\\" which featured a sample from the duo Cheech & Chong. Despite an online leak of the album two days prior, Revival was released as planned on December 15. On January 5, 2018, the second single \\\"River\\\" was released, which featured Ed Sheeran. It became Eminem's eighth consecutive album to top the US Billboard 200 upon release with 197,000 copies sold in its first week. As a result, he became the first musical act to have eight entries in a row debut atop the chart. The album was met with mixed reviews from music critics.In 2018, an extended edition of \\\"Nowhere Fast\\\" with Kehlani and a remix of \\\"Chloraseptic\\\" featuring 2 Chainz and Phresher were released from Revival.On August 31, 2018, Eminem released his previously unannounced tenth studio album Kamikaze, making it his second full-length studio album in 8 months.\\n\\n\\n== Artistry ==\\n\\n\\n=== Influences, style, and rapping technique ===\\nEminem has cited several MCs as influencing his rapping style, including Esham, Kool G Rap, Masta Ace, Big Daddy Kane, Newcleus, Ice-T, Mantronix, Melle Mel (on \\\"The Message\\\"), LL Cool J, Beastie Boys, Run-D.M.C., Rakim and Boogie Down Productions.\\nIn How to Rap, Guerilla Black notes that Eminem studied other MCs to hone his rapping technique: \\\"Eminem listened to everything and that's what made him one of the greats\\\". In the book, other MCs also praise aspects of his rapping technique; varied, humorous subject matter, connecting with his audience, carrying a concept over a series of albums, complex rhyme schemes, bending words so they rhyme, multisyllabic rhymes, many rhymes to a bar, complex rhythms, clear enunciation and the use of melody and syncopation. Eminem is known to write most of his lyrics on paper (documented in The Way I Am), taking several days or a week to craft lyrics, being a \\\"workaholic\\\" and \\\"stacking\\\" vocals. Examples of hip hop subgenres that Eminem's music has been described as include horrorcore, comedy hip hop, and hardcore hip hop.\\n\\n\\n=== Alter egos ===\\nEminem uses alter egos in his songs for different rapping styles and subject matter. His best-known alter ego, Slim Shady, first appeared on the Slim Shady EP. In this persona his songs are violent and dark, with a comic twist. Eminem downplayed Slim Shady on Recovery because he felt it did not fit the album's theme.\\n\\n\\n=== Collaborations and productions ===\\n\\nAlthough Eminem usually collaborates with Aftermath Entertainment and Shady Records rappers such as Dr. Dre, 50 Cent, D12, Obie Trice and Yelawolf, he has also worked with Redman, Kid Rock, DMX, Lil Wayne, Missy Elliott, Jay Z, Drake, Rihanna, Nicki Minaj, Xzibit, Method Man, Jadakiss, Fat Joe, Sticky Fingaz, T.I. and Young Jeezy. Eminem rapped a verse in a live performance of Busta Rhymes' \\\"Touch It\\\" remix at the June 27, 2006 BET Music Awards. He appeared on Akon's single \\\"Smack That\\\" from  Konvicted, Lil Wayne's hit \\\"Drop the World\\\", and \\\"My Life\\\" (the lead single from 50 Cent's Street King Immortal).\\nEminem was the executive producer of D12's first two albums (Devil's Night and D12 World), Obie Trice's Cheers and Second Round's on Me and 50 Cent's Get Rich or Die Tryin' and The Massacre. He has produced songs for other rappers, such as Jadakiss' \\\"Welcome To D-Block\\\", Jay-Z's \\\"Renegade\\\" and \\\"Moment of Clarity\\\", Lloyd Banks' \\\"On Fire\\\", \\\"Warrior Part 2\\\" and \\\"Hands Up\\\", Tony Yayo's \\\"Drama Setter\\\", Trick-Trick's \\\"Welcome 2 Detroit\\\", and Xzibit's \\\"My Name\\\" and \\\"Don't Approach Me\\\". Most of The Eminem Show was produced by Eminem and his longtime collaborator, Jeff Bass, and Eminem co-produced Encore with Dr. Dre. In 2004 Eminem was co-executive producer of 2Pac's posthumous album Loyal to the Game with Shakur's mother, Afeni. He produced the UK number-one single \\\"Ghetto Gospel\\\", featuring Elton John, \\\"The Cross\\\" from the Nas album God's Son and eight tracks on Obie Trice's 2006 Second Round's on Me (also appearing on \\\"There They Go\\\"). Eminem produced several tracks on Trick-Trick's The Villain (appearing on \\\"Who Want It\\\"), and produced four tracks on Cashis' 2013 album The County Hound 2.\\nEminem is considered unusual in structuring his songs around the lyrics, rather than writing to beats. One exception was \\\"Stan\\\", which came from an idea and scratch track produced by the 45 King. After doing little production on Relapse and Recovery, Eminem produced a significant portion of The Marshall Mathers LP 2. He said about producing his own music, \\\"Sometimes, I may get something in my head, like an idea or the mood of something that I would want, and I'm not always gonna get that by going through different tracks that other people have made. They don't know what's in my head. I think maybe it helps, a little bit, with diversity, the sound of it, but also, I would get something in my head and want to be able to lay down that idea from scratch.\\\"\\n\\n\\n=== Comparisons with other artists ===\\nAs a white performer prominent in a genre influenced by black artists, Eminem has been compared, much to his chagrin, to Elvis Presley, and as a lyricist and as aforementioned to Bob Dylan. Rapper Asher Roth has been compared to Eminem, and Roth devoted a song on his album (\\\"As I Em\\\") to him, which he took offense to. The accomplished trumpeter Nicholas Payton has called Eminem \\\"the Bix Beiderbecke of hip hop\\\".\\nEminem and Christian hip hop artist KJ-52 have been compared to each other, with KJ-52 called his \\\"Christian counterpart\\\". KJ-52's single, \\\"Dear Slim\\\", was controversial with Eminem fans when it appeared on Total Request Live. Although he said the song was not intended to be disrespectful, KJ-52 received hate mail and the song was number 26 on VH1's Top 40 Worst Moments in Hip Hop list.\\n\\n\\n== Personal life ==\\n\\n\\n=== Family ===\\nEminem has been scrutinized, as a rapper and personally. He was married twice to Kimberly Anne \\\"Kim\\\" Scott. He met Kim in high school while he stood on a table with his shirt off rapping LL Cool J's \\\"I'm Bad\\\". Kim and her twin sister Dawn had run away from home; they moved in with Eminem and his mother when he was 15, and he began an on-and-off relationship with Kim in 1989. Their daughter Hailie was born on December 25, 1995. The two were married in 1999 and divorced in 2001. Although Eminem told Rolling Stone in 2002, \\\"I would rather have a baby through my penis than get married again\\\", he and Kim briefly remarried in January 2006. He filed for divorce in early April, agreeing to joint custody of Hailie. He also has custody of Dawn's daughter Alaina and Whitney, Kim's daughter from another relationship. In early 2010, Eminem denied tabloid reports that he and Kim had renewed their romantic relationship; however, in the same statement his representative also confirmed that they now maintain a friendly relationship. He had legal custody of his younger half-brother Nathan. In his 2014 song \\\"Headlights\\\", Eminem apologized to, and reiterated his love for, his mother.\\n\\n\\n=== Legal issues ===\\nIn 1999, Eminem's mother sued him for about $10 million for slandering her on The Slim Shady LP, receiving about $1,600 in damages in 2001.  On June 3, 2000, Eminem was arrested during an altercation with Douglas Dail at a car-audio store in Royal Oak, Michigan, when he pulled out an unloaded gun and pointed it at the ground. The next day, in Warren, Michigan, he was arrested again for assaulting John Guerrera in the parking lot of the Hot Rock Cafe when he saw him kissing his wife. Eminem recreated the Guerrera assault in \\\"The Kiss (Skit)\\\" on The Eminem Show. He was charged for possession of a concealed weapon and assault, pleaded guilty and received two years' probation; however, Guerrera's assault charge was dropped as part of the plea agreement. On July 7, 2000, Kim attempted suicide by slashing her wrists, and later sued Eminem for defamation after describing her violent death in \\\"Kim\\\".On October 26, 2000, Eminem was scheduled to perform at Toronto's SkyDome when Ontario Attorney General Jim Flaherty said that Eminem should not be allowed to enter the country. \\\"I personally don't want anyone coming to Canada who will come here and advocate violence against women\\\", he said. Flaherty also said that he was \\\"disgusted\\\" when he read the lyrics of \\\"Kill You\\\", which includes the lines \\\"Slut, you think I won't choke no whore / Till the vocal cords don't work in her throat no more?\\\" Although public reaction to Flaherty's position was generally negative, with barring Eminem from the country considered a free-speech issue, Liberal MPP Michael Bryant suggested that hate crime charges be brought against Eminem for advocating violence against women in his lyrics. Robert Everett-Green wrote in a Globe and Mail editorial, \\\"Being offensive is Eminem's job description\\\". Eminem's Toronto concert went on as planned.Sanitation worker DeAngelo Bailey sued Eminem for $1 million in 2001, accusing him of invading his privacy by publicizing information placing him in a false light in \\\"Brain Damage\\\", a song which portrays him as a violent school bully. Although Bailey admitted picking on Eminem in school, he said he merely \\\"bumped\\\" him and gave him a \\\"little shove\\\". The lawsuit was dismissed on October 20, 2003; Judge Deborah Servitto, who wrote a portion of her opinion in rap-like rhyming verse, ruled that it was clear to the public that the lyrics were exaggerated.On June 28, 2001, Eminem was sentenced to one year's probation and community service and was fined about $2,000 on weapon charges stemming from an argument with an employee of Psychopathic Records.On March 31, 2002, French jazz pianist Jacques Loussier filed a $10 million lawsuit against Eminem and Dr. Dre, claiming that the beat for \\\"Kill You\\\" was taken from his instrumental \\\"Pulsion\\\". Loussier demanded that sales of The Marshall Mathers LP be halted, and any remaining copies destroyed. The case was later settled out of court.On December 8, 2003, the United States Secret Service reported that it was \\\"looking into\\\" allegations that Eminem threatened U.S. President George W. Bush in \\\"We As Americans\\\" (an unreleased bootleg at the time), with the lyrics: \\\"Fuck money, I don't rap for dead presidents. I'd rather see the president dead, it's never been said but I set precedents.\\\" The incident was included in the video for \\\"Mosh\\\", as a newspaper clipping on a wall with articles about unfortunate incidents in Bush's career. \\\"We As Americans\\\" eventually appeared on Encore's deluxe-edition bonus disc, with altered lyrics.\\nIn 2007, Eminem's music-publishing company (Eight Mile Style) and Martin Affiliated sued Apple Inc. and Aftermath Entertainment, claiming that Aftermath was not authorized to negotiate a deal with Apple for digital downloads of 93 Eminem songs on Apple's iTunes. The case against Apple was settled shortly after the trial began, in late September 2009.In July 2010, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled in F.B.T. Productions, LLC v. Aftermath Records that F.B.T. Productions and Eminem were owed a royalty of 50 percent of Aftermath's net revenue from licensing his recordings to companies such as Apple, Sprint Corporation, Nextel Communications, Cingular and T-Mobile. In March 2011, the Supreme Court of the United States declined to hear the case.In October 2013, Eminem sampled Chicago-based rap group Hotstylz's 2008 viral hit, \\\"Lookin' Boy\\\", for his 2013 hit single, \\\"Rap God\\\".  The group claims that Eminem did not receive permission to use the sample, nor did he credit or compensate them. In November 2013, Hotstylz released a diss track towards Eminem titled \\\"Rap Fraud\\\", where they sample several of his songs and criticize him for not crediting them. In January 2015, TMZ reported that Hotstylz was suing Eminem and his label, Shady Records, for $8 million, for using the 25 second sample of \\\"Lookin' Boy\\\" on his song \\\"Rap God\\\", without their permission.\\n\\n\\n=== Health issues ===\\nEminem has spoken publicly about his addiction to prescription drugs, including Vicodin, Ambien and Valium. According to friend and fellow D12 member Proof, Eminem first straightened out in 2002. During the production of 8 Mile, Eminem, working 16 hours a day, developed insomnia. An associate gave him an Ambien tablet which \\\"knocked [him] out\\\", encouraging him to obtain a prescription. This was Eminem's first experience of drug addiction, which would affect him for several years. Near the end of production on Encore, he would \\\"just go into the studio and goof off [with] a pocketful of pills\\\". Eminem began taking the drugs to \\\"feel normal\\\", taking a \\\"ridiculous amount [...] I could consume anywhere from 40 to 60 Valium [in a day]. Vicodin, maybe 30\\\". The drugs would put him to sleep for no more than two hours, after which he would take more. Eminem's weight increased to 230 pounds (100 kg), and he was regularly eating fast food: \\\"The kids behind the counter knew me - it wouldn't even faze them. Or I'd sit up at Denny's or Big Boy and just eat by myself. It was sad\\\". Eminem became less recognizable due to his weight gain, and once overheard two teenagers arguing about whether or not it was him: \\\"Eminem ain't fat.\\\"In December 2007, Eminem was hospitalized after a methadone overdose he had first bought from a dealer who had told him it was \\\"just like Vicodin, and easier on [your] liver\\\". He continued to buy more, until he collapsed in his bathroom one night and was rushed to the hospital. Doctors there told him he had ingested the equivalent of four bags of heroin and was \\\"about two hours from dying\\\". After missing Christmas with his children, Eminem checked himself out of the facility weak and not fully detoxed. He tore the meniscus in his knee after falling asleep on his sofa, requiring surgery; after he returned home, he had a seizure. His drug use \\\"ramped right back to where it was before\\\" within a month. Eminem began to attend church meetings to get clean, but after he was asked for autographs he sought help from a rehabilitation counselor. He began an exercise program which emphasized running. Elton John was a mentor during this period, calling Eminem once a week to check on him.In the book My Son Marshall, My Son Eminem, his mother stated that he has struggled with bipolar disorder throughout his life. She said it worsened after his ex-wife Kim Mathers gave birth to their daughter Hailie.In April 2018, Eminem stated that he had been sober for 10 years.\\n\\n\\n=== Allegations of homophobia ===\\nSome of Eminem's lyrics have been considered homophobic, and an Australian politician attempted to ban him from the country. Eminem denies the charge, saying that when he was growing up words such as \\\"faggot\\\" and \\\"queer\\\" were used generally in a derogatory manner and not specifically toward homosexuals. During a 60 Minutes interview, journalist Anderson Cooper explored the issue:\\nCooper: Some of the lyrics, like, you know, in the song \\\"Criminal\\\" you say \\\"My words are like a dagger with a jagged edge, That'll stab you in the head, whether you're a fag or lez, Or the homosex, hermaph or a trans-a-vest, Pants or dress--hate fags? The answer's 'yes'\\\".\\nEminem: Yeah, this scene I came up in. That word was thrown around so much, you know, \\\"faggot\\\" was like thrown around constantly to each other, like in battling.\\nCooper: Do you not like gay people?\\nEminem: No, I don't have any problem with nobody. You know what I mean? I'm just like whatever.When The New York Times asked him about the legalization of same-sex marriage in Michigan in 2010, Eminem replied: \\\"I think if two people love each other, then what the hell? I think that everyone should have the chance to be equally miserable, if they want\\\", adding that his \\\"overall look on things is a lot more mature than it used to be\\\".Eminem was accused yet again of using homophobic words in his lyrics in \\\"Rap God\\\" (2013), and explained \\\"I don't know how to say this without saying it how I've said it a million times. But that word, those kind of words, when I came up battle-rappin' or whatever, I never really equated those words...\\\"\\n\\n\\n== Legacy ==\\n\\nEminem is considered one of the greatest hip-hop artists of all time. He was 83rd on Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Artists of All Time and 79th on the VH1 100 Greatest Artists of All Time lists. In 2010, MTV Portugal ranked Eminem the seventh-biggest icon in pop-music history.He was the bestselling artist from 2000 to 2009 in the US according to Nielsen SoundScan, and has sold 47.4 million albums in the country. With global sales of 220 million records, he is one world's best-selling artists of all time. Eminem has over ten billion views of his music videos on his YouTube Vevo page. In 2010, Eminem's music generated 94 million streams (more than any other musical artist), and in May 2014 Spotify called him the most-streamed artist of all time. According to Billboard, two of Eminem's albums are among the top-five bestselling albums from 2000 to 2010. \\\"Love the Way You Lie\\\" (11x platinum), \\\"Lose Yourself\\\" (10x platinum), and \\\"Not Afraid\\\" (10x platinum) are all certified diamond by the RIAA, making him the first artist with two then three digital diamond-certified songs in the US. In the UK, Eminem has sold over 12.5 million records. As of June 2014, Eminem is the second-bestselling male artist of the Nielsen SoundScan era, the sixth-bestselling artist in the United States and the bestselling hip-hop artist, with sales of 45.1 million albums and 42 million tracks (including 31 million digital single certifications). Eminem has had ten number-one albums on the Billboard 200: seven solo (five original albums and two compilations), two with D12 and one with Bad Meets Evil. The Eminem Show, The Marshall Mathers LP, and Encore were ranked the third-, seventh- and fortieth-bestselling albums of the 2000-2009 decade, respectively. Eminem has had 13 number-one singles worldwide. Eminem has been credited of rising the careers of rap proteges such as 50 Cent, Yelawolf, Stat Quo, Royce da 5'9\\\", Cashis, Obie Trice, Bobby Creekwater, and rap groups such as D12 and Slaughterhouse.\\nIn August 2011, Eminem was called the King of Hip-Hop by Rolling Stone, which analyzed album sales, R&B, hip-hop and rap chart positions, YouTube views, social media, concert grosses, industry awards and critical ratings of solo rappers who released music from 2009 to the first half of 2011. His second major-label album, The Marshall Mathers LP, was the fastest-selling solo album in US history and was ranked one of the greatest hip-hop albums of all time by Rolling Stone, Time and XXL. Rolling Stone ranked it the seventh-best album of the first decade of the 21st century. The album's third single (\\\"Stan\\\") is one of Eminem's most critically acclaimed songs, with Pitchfork calling it \\\"a cultural milestone\\\".A number of artists have cited Eminem as an influence, including Regina Spektor, The Weeknd, Crooked I, Tech N9ne, Logic, Lil Wayne, Nicki Minaj, T.I., B.o.B, Jhene Aiko, 50 Cent, Usher, Earl Sweatshirt, Ab-Soul, Freddie Gibbs, Kendrick Lamar, Ed Sheeran, Lana Del Rey, Big Sean, J. Cole, Skylar Grey, Bubba Sparxxx, Asher Roth, Machine Gun Kelly, Yelawolf, Hopsin, Tyler, The Creator, Hollywood Undead, Kiiara, Chris Webby, Chance the Rapper, Stalley, Royce da 5'9\\\", Joe Budden, Tony Yayo, and The Game.Rappers David Banner, Wiz Khalifa, Drake, 50 Cent, Talib Kweli, Kool G. Rap, Redman, Kurupt, Dr. Dre, N.O.R.E., Royce Da 5'9\\\", Rakim, Busta Rhymes, Nick Cannon, Yelawolf, and Jay-Z have each called Eminem one of the greatest rappers of all time.\\n\\n\\n== Honors and awards ==\\n\\nHe shared the 2002 Academy Award for Best Original Song for his song Lose Yourself, co-written with Jeff Bass and Luis Resto. His Academy Award win made him the first rapper to receive this award.Eminem has received fifteen Grammy Awards, has been praised for his \\\"verbal energy\\\" and lyrical quality and was ranked ninth on MTV's Greatest MCs of All Time list. In 2003, he was thirteenth on MTV's 22 Greatest Voices in Music list and 82nd on Rolling Stone's Immortals list. In 2008, Vibe readers named Eminem the Best Rapper Alive.\\\"The Real Slim Shady\\\" (from Eminem's second Grammy-winning album, The Marshall Mathers LP) criticizes the awards in its second verse, with Eminem believing at the time that negative opinion of his material would prevent him from ever winning one. Eminem received the Global Icon Award at the 2013 MTV Europe Music Awards in Amsterdam.\\n\\n\\n== Other ventures ==\\n\\n\\n=== Shady Records and D12 ===\\n\\nAfter Eminem's Multi-Platinum record sales, Interscope offered him his own label; he and Paul Rosenberg founded Shady Records in late 1999. Eminem signed his Detroit collective, D12, and rapper Obie Trice to the label and signed 50 Cent in a 2002 joint venture with Dr. Dre's Aftermath label. In 2003, Eminem and Dr. Dre added Atlanta rapper Stat Quo to the Shady-Aftermath roster. DJ Green Lantern, Eminem's former DJ, was with Shady Records until a dispute related to the 50 Cent-Jadakiss feud forced him to leave the label. The Alchemist is currently Eminem's tour DJ. In 2005 Eminem signed another Atlanta rapper, Bobby Creekwater, and West Coast rapper Cashis to Shady Records.On December 5, 2006, the compilation album Eminem Presents: The Re-Up was released on Shady Records. The project began as a mixtape, but when Eminem found the material better than expected he released it as an album. The Re-Up was intended to introduce Stat Quo, Cashis and Bobby Creekwater. While he was recording Infinite, Eminem, Proof and Kon Artis assembled a group of fellow rappers now known as D12, short for \\\"Detroit Twelve\\\" or \\\"Dirty Dozen\\\", who performed in a style similar to Wu-Tang Clan. In 2001 D12's debut album, Devil's Night, was released. The first single from the album was \\\"Shit on You\\\", followed by \\\"Purple Pills\\\" (an ode to recreational drug use) and \\\"Fight Music\\\". \\\"Purple Pills\\\" was rewritten for radio and television, removing many of the song's references to drugs and sex, and renamed \\\"Purple Hills\\\".\\nAfter their debut, D12 took a three-year break from the studio. They reunited in 2004 for their second album, D12 World, which included the hit singles \\\"My Band\\\" and \\\"How Come\\\". \\\"American Psycho 2\\\" featuring Cypress Hill member, B-Real, was another popular hit. According to D12 member Bizarre, Eminem was not featured on his album Blue Cheese & Coney Island because \\\"he's busy doing his thing\\\".In January 2014, Bass Brothers announced that D12 had returned to record at F.B.T. Studio and they were working on an album with Eminem on at least three songs. Bizarre reported that he was still part of the group and that the album was scheduled for a 2014 release.\\n\\n\\n=== Acting career ===\\nAfter small roles in the 2001, film The Wash and as an extra in the 1998 Korn music video for Got the Life (during which he gave the band a demo tape), Eminem made his Hollywood debut in the quasi-autobiographical 2002 film 8 Mile. He said it was a representation of growing up in Detroit rather than an account of his life. He recorded several new songs for the soundtrack, including \\\"Lose Yourself\\\" (which won an Academy Award for Best Original Song in 2003 and became the longest-running #1 hip hop single in history). Eminem was absent from the ceremony, and co-composer Luis Resto accepted the award.Eminem has voiced the video game 50 Cent: Bulletproof (as an aging, corrupt, Ebonics-speaking police officer) and guested on the Comedy Central television show Crank Yankers and a Web cartoon, The Slim Shady Show He was signed to star in an unmade film version of Have Gun - Will Travel, and was considered for the role of David Rice in the 2008 film Jumper. Eminem had a cameo appearance, arguing with Ray Romano, in the 2009 film Funny People.\\nHe played himself in the Entourage season-seven finale \\\"Lose Yourself\\\" with Christina Aguilera. Although Eminem was offered the lead role in the 2013 science-fiction film Elysium, he turned it down because director Neill Blomkamp would not change its location from Los Angeles to Detroit. Eminem had a cameo appearance as himself in the 2014 film The Interview. During an interview with the main character, Dave Skylark (James Franco), Eminem satirically comes out as homosexual.\\n\\n\\n=== Memoirs ===\\nEminem's autobiography, The Way I Am, was published October 21, 2008. Detailing his struggles with poverty, drugs, fame, heartbreak and depression, it includes stories of his rise to fame, commentary about past controversies and original lyric sheets from \\\"Stan\\\" and \\\"The Real Slim Shady\\\". An autobiography of Eminem's mother (My Son Marshall, My Son Eminem) was published the following month, in which Debbie Nelson describes her childhood and adolescence, meeting Eminem's father and her son's rise to (and struggles with) fame.\\n\\n\\n=== Advertising and charity ===\\nEminem appeared in two commercials which were shown during Super Bowl XLV. In the first, a one-minute spot for Lipton's Brisk iced tea, he is a claymation figure. In the second, a two-minute ad - the longest in Super Bowl history at the time - for the Chrysler 200, Eminem drives through Detroit (with \\\"Lose Yourself\\\" as the soundtrack) to his show at the Fox Theatre.He established the Marshall Mathers Foundation to aid disadvantaged youth. The foundation works in conjunction with a charity founded by Norman Yatooma, a Detroit attorney.\\n\\n\\n=== Royalty Flow ===\\nIn September 2017, a company called Royalty Flow (a subsidiary of Royalty Exchange), filed to issue an IPO under SEC Regulation A+ to raise money with the intent of purchasing either 15% or 25% of Eminem's former production team's (The Bass Brothers, aka FBT Productions) share of his sound recording royalties.\\n\\n\\n== Discography ==\\n\\nInfinite (1996)\\nThe Slim Shady LP (1999)\\nThe Marshall Mathers LP (2000)\\nThe Eminem Show (2002)\\nEncore (2004)\\nRelapse (2009)\\nRecovery (2010)\\nThe Marshall Mathers LP 2 (2013)\\nRevival (2017)\\nKamikaze (2018)\\n\\n\\n== Tours ==\\n\\nAs a headliner\\n\\nThe Recovery Tour (2010-2013)\\nRapture Tour (2014)\\nRevival Tour (2018)As a co-headliner\\n\\nUp in Smoke Tour (with Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Ice Cube and others) (2000)\\nAnger Management Tour (with Limp Bizkit and Papa Roach) (2002-2005)\\nThe Home & Home Tour (with Jay Z) (2010)\\nThe Monster Tour (with Rihanna) (2014)\\n\\n\\n== Books ==\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\nWorks cited\\n\\nBozza, Anthony (2003).

The cast struggled to cope with the censorship often imposed on the show including forbidding certain footage from ever being released and opted to not return to the show, continuing the rest of the franchise as a series of feature films benefiting from looser content restrictions.\\nThe show placed #68 on Entertainment Weekly's \\\"New TV Classics\\\" list, and is a significant part in 2000s American popular culture.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nThe show developed from Big Brother Magazine, a skateboarding-related humor magazine that Jeff Tremaine, Dave Carnie, Rick Kosick and Chris Pontius all worked for, and featured regular contributions from Johnny Knoxville and Dave England, among others. The concept of Jackass dates back to 1998, when failing-actor-turned-writer Johnny Knoxville thought of the idea of testing different self-defense devices on himself as the basis for an article. He pitched the idea to a couple of magazines and was turned down until meeting with Jeff Tremaine of Big Brother. Tremaine hired him as a journalist and convinced Johnny to videotape this idea and other stunts for stories. The footage, which involved Knoxville being tasered, maced, and shot while wearing a bulletproof vest, appeared in the second Big Brother skateboarding movie: Number 2. Future Jackass cast member Wee-Man made an appearance in the videos as well.\\nDuring this time, Bam Margera released a movie titled Landspeed:CKY, consisting of himself and his friends, which he dubbed the \\\"CKY Crew\\\", in West Chester, Pennsylvania, performing various skits and stunts. The Crew included the colorful cast of Ryan Dunn, Brandon Dicamillo, and Raab Himself, as well as Margera's family April, Phil, Don Vito, and Jess Margera. Tremaine saw the tapes and drafted Margera and his crew into what would become the cast of Jackass. Later, the Jackass crew would recruit Steve-O in a Florida flea market where he worked as a clown. To round out the cast, England brought in his friend Ehren McGhehey, a fellow Oregon resident and extreme stunt participant. Preston Lacy would be the last of what is now considered the main cast to join, auditioning midway through the show's run by eating four bananas with the peels on.\\nTremaine drafted his friend, director Spike Jonze, to get involved with the show, and together, he, Jonze, and Knoxville served as executive producers. The show idea was pitched, and the cast was initially given an offer by Saturday Night Live to perform the stunts weekly for the show, though the offer was turned down. A bidding war occurred between Comedy Central and MTV, which MTV eventually won. It was then that Jackass was born.\\n\\n\\n== Main cast ==\\n\\n\\n== Controversy ==\\nAt the time of its first broadcast in 2000, Jackass frequently featured warnings and disclaimers noting that the stunts performed were very dangerous and should not be imitated. Such warnings not only appeared before and after each program and after each commercial break, but also in a \\\"crawl\\\" that ran along the bottom of the screen during some especially risky stunts, as well as showing their \\\"skull and crutches\\\" logo at the bottom right of the screen to symbolize the stunt performed as risky. Nevertheless, the program has been blamed for a number of deaths and injuries involving teens and children recreating the stunts.Connecticut Senator Joe Lieberman followed up with a February 7, 2001 letter to MTV's parent company Viacom urging the company to take greater responsibility for its programming and do more to help parents protect their children. MTV responded to the criticism by canceling all airings of Jackass before 10 p.m., but Lieberman's continual campaign against the show led to MTV refusing to air repeats of the later episodes, a move which angered the cast and production crew of the series who were furious with MTV's \\\"caving into Lieberman's demands\\\".\\nA Montana man named Jack Ass sued MTV for $10 million in 2002, claiming that the show was plagiarizing his name. Jack Ass, whose birth name was Bob Craft, changed his name in 1997 to raise awareness for drunk driving, after his brother and friend both died in a car accident.Matt-Dillion Shannon, an 18-year-old from Napier, New Zealand, was sentenced on November 23, 2012 to three years in prison on a charge of causing grievous bodily harm for his role in the August 2011 dousing of a 16-year-old with gasoline and setting him alight. Shannon's lawyer claimed that this act was inspired by the Jackass series, despite the fact that no such stunt ever aired on the show.\\n\\n\\n== Series finale and DVD releases ==\\nIn a 2001 interview with Rolling Stone, Knoxville questioned how long the MTV show could last, and soon after announced that the series would end after its third season aired. He also stated discontent with MTV and the censors, who, from the start of season two, increasingly gave notes regarding what the show could and could not depict. In addition, Steve-O claimed that the cast salaries paid by MTV were meager. When the third season ended in 2001, MTV (which owns the rights to the name \\\"Jackass\\\") contemplated keeping the show going with a new cast (even running a teaser for the show's return during the 2002 VMA Awards Show).Because of problems with MTV's standards and practices department, as well as the sudden departure of Bam and the CKY crew halfway through season three, the Jackass crew did not attempt to create a finale to bring the show to a close. MTV released a three disc DVD box set entitled \\\"Jackass: The Box Set\\\" in December 2005. This set does not contain the three complete seasons, but rather three volumes of highlights, one for each season. Each volume also contains additional commentaries for various stunts. The box set also includes a special bonus disc that includes the crew's trip to the Gumball 3000 rally, a special \\\"Where Are They Now?\\\" documentary, MTV Cribs: Jackass Edition, appearances by the crew at the 2002 MTV VMAs and the 2002 MTV Latin VMAs, and a bonus 48-page collector's booklet of rare photos and inside stories on the history of Jackass. \\nAnother compilation of stunts from the television series was released in 2009, entitled \\\"Jackass: The Lost Tapes\\\". However, unlike the box set, this is only one DVD. It features stunts that weren't featured in \\\"Jackass: The Box Set\\\". This DVD includes such stunts as \\\"Self Defense Test\\\", \\\"Stun Collar\\\", \\\"Unicycle Poo Barf\\\", \\\"Fast Food Football\\\", \\\"Roller Jump\\\", and the original and controversial \\\"Satan vs. God\\\". It also includes various bonus features, such as every opening to every televised episode of Jackass, original credit montages from each televised episode, and an inside look at jackassworld.com, featuring various skits. \\nA third compilation, titled \\\"Jackass: The Classic TV Collection\\\", was released in 2014. It combined all three of the DVDs from the box set with \\\"The Lost Tapes\\\".\\n\\n\\n== Spin-offs and life after Jackass ==\\nWhen the TV series ended, each member of the cast found new work in movies and television, each gaining his own degree of success. Knoxville pursued a career as an actor, appearing in such films as the 2004 remake of Walking Tall, The Dukes of Hazzard, Men in Black II, The Ringer, A Dirty Shame, Big Trouble and The Last Stand.\\nMargera and the CKY crew were given their own spin-off show Viva La Bam, which follows Margera and his family, who are often made the victim of the clique's practical jokes. Bam and the crew also have Radio Bam on Sirius radio. Margera has also been featured in Bam's Unholy Union, following him and his fiance Missy in the run-up to their wedding, while Brandon DiCamillo and Rake Yohn featured in Blastazoid, a short-lived show about video games.\\nWhen Viva La Bam finished its run, Ryan Dunn, who was part of Bam's crew on Viva La Bam, was given his own show Homewrecker, in which he finds revenge for helpless victims of practical jokes by renovating the prankster's room according to the original incident. The show only lasted one season. On June 20, 2011, Dunn was killed in a car crash while driving drunk in Pennsylvania.Pontius and Steve-O were also given their own spin-off show Wildboyz. Unlike Jackass and Viva La Bam, Wildboyz rejected the formula of practical jokes and instead features the two traveling the world in search of wild and exotic animals. Directed by Jackass director Jeff Tremaine, Wildboyz featured frequent guest appearances by fellow Jackasses Johnny Knoxville, Manny Puig, and Jason \\\"Wee Man\\\" Acuna.\\n\\n\\n== Films ==\\n\\n\\n=== MTV takeover special ===\\nOn February 23, 2008, MTV held the TV special, Jackassworld.com: 24 Hour Takeover to coincide with the official launch of Jackassworld.com. The special allowed the core members of Jackass to take over MTV and its studios for 24 hours, broadcasting new pranks and stunts, along with a tribute to stunt man Evel Knievel shot days before.\\n\\n\\n=== Jackass: The Movie ===\\n\\nAfter the show went off the air, the cast reunited in 2002 to film what they believed would be the conclusion of Jackass: a full-length motion picture version of the show entitled Jackass: The Movie. The cast made it clear that the film was their \\\"farewell\\\" to the fans of the show, and with the franchise taking the movie format, the cast and crew were now allowed to circumvent the censors, showing more vulgar stunts than the ones featured on the TV show. Despite earlier disagreements, MTV Films assisted in the film's distribution.\\nThe film, shot on a budget of just $5 million, went on to gross over $60 million in the United States alone, and finished in the #1 spot at the box office during its debut weekend.\\n\\n\\n=== Jackass Number Two ===\\n\\nWith the release of Jackass: The Movie, director Jeff Tremaine and the rest of the cast believed that Jackass was finished and there would be no further projects under the franchise. However, during the final season of Wildboyz, Knoxville joined his former castmates Chris Pontius and Steve-O on various expeditions around the world. It was said that Knoxville went so far out during the filming of the show that Tremaine pulled him aside and said \\\"If you're willing to go this all out, why not get all the guys together and shoot another movie?\\\" Knoxville agreed, and with both Viva La Bam and Wildboyz finishing their runs, the entire cast was available to reunite and film the sequel.Number Two was released on September 22, 2006, produced by MTV Films and distributed by Paramount Pictures. As was the case with its predecessor, Jackass Number Two topped the box office in its debut weekend, earning $29.01 million. Footage for several stunts featured Bam Margera's uncle Vincent \\\"Don Vito\\\" Margera, but the footage was removed from the theatrical and DVD release due to his arrest in August 2006 and conviction on two counts of sexual assault on a minor.\\nOn September 7, 2006, MTV featured a half-hour documentary of Jackass: Number Two. When asked if the film meant the end of Jackass, cast member Steve-O jokingly commented that the people who made money from the franchise still wanted money, hinting that the cast would still continue the franchise in one form or another. At the conclusion of the documentary, Johnny Knoxville reveals that he \\\"had a hard time letting go\\\" because he is \\\"so hooked on doing stunts.\\\" Cameraman Dimitry Elyashkevich reveals that weeks after the film, Knoxville was so desperate to shoot that he would film himself running into street signs just for the sake of additional footage.\\n\\n\\n=== Jackass 2.5 ===\\nOn September 5, 2007, Margera announced the release of Jackass 2.5 on The Howard Stern Show, a compilation DVD of stunts that did not make it to Jackass Number Two. The DVD was released on December 26, 2007. Special features on the DVD include the making of Jackass 2.5, the making of Jackass: The Game, deleted scenes, and a photo gallery.\\n\\n\\n=== Jackass Presents: Mat Hoffman's Tribute to Evel Knievel ===\\n\\nOn May 27, 2008 a direct-to-DVD Jackass film was released by Dickhouse Productions. The film is a tribute to the stuntman, Evel Knievel, who died on November 30, 2007, one year before the film's release.\\n\\n\\n=== Jackass 3D ===\\n\\nIn an August 2009 interview with Knoxville for The Times-Picayune, Knoxville, on the topic of Steve-O's recovery and rehabilitation, said, \\\"He's taking to sobriety like he took to drugs and alcohol, I'm very proud of him. I think we'll see him doing some stuff here really soon. As a matter of fact, I know we are.\\\" He later stated \\\"Something's coming. We're pretty excited.\\\" Later, he added, \\\"I think it'll be a big year next year, but I don't want to talk about it yet ...\\\"In September 2009, Margera revealed to Iltalehti, a Finnish newspaper, that a Jackass 3 would be made and filmed in places like Mongolia, South Africa and Finland as well as the United States starting in January 2010. He then confirmed it again on Radio Bam on September 21, 2009. In early December, Knoxville confirmed that Jackass 3 was being made. In April 2010, a brief blurb about Jackass 3D, entitled \\\"gone filmin',\\\" appeared on the Jackassworld Web site: \\\"Thanks for the support the past two years. To keep abreast and adick of all things related to the world of jackass and Dickhouse (including the currently in production flick Jackass 3D), follow us on Facebook and Twitter.\\\"In late July 2010, Paramount and MTV screened the first footage from Jackass 3D at a special event during Comic-Con 2010 in its 3D format. The event allowed fans to meet the Jackass crew. Then in August 2010, the official trailer was aired on MTV.\\nJackass 3D was released in American movie theaters on October 15, 2010. On opening weekend, the movie made an estimated $50 million in 3,081 theaters, outperforming predictions it would earn $30 million and breaking the record for the most successful Fall opening ever, which was previously held by Scary Movie 3.\\n\\n\\n=== Jackass 3.5 ===\\nJackass 3.5 was released in June 2011 with unused footage shot during the filming of Jackass 3D. The first trailer was released online on January 27, 2011 and the feature-length movie was released on VOD and DVD on June 14, 2011, and the entire film was streamed in weekly segments on Joost, starting April 1, 2011.\\n\\n\\n=== Jackass Presents: Bad Grandpa ===\\n\\nIn March 2012, Knoxville discussed the possibility of a fourth film, saying \\\"we're keeping our mind open\\\" and \\\"I've got 50-60 ideas on top of all the stuff we didn't get to shoot.\\\" Then in June 2012, it was reported Paramount \\\"registered several domains for a film that would be called Bad Grandpa.\\\"During Margera's September 18, 2012 interview on The Howard Stern Show about Jackass he said: \\\"There's going to be a whole movie about Knoxville's grandpa character.\\\"\\nBad Grandpa was officially announced in July 2013 and released on October 25, 2013, exactly 11 years after the release of Jackass: The Movie. It was the first film in the series to be nominated for an Academy Award; it lost the Best Makeup and Hairstyling award to Dallas Buyers Club.\\n\\n\\n=== Future ===\\nIn an interview, Bam Margera suggested  Jackass 4: We're Not Dunn Yet, referring to Ryan Dunn, could be the title of a fourth film, which Tremaine has said he would like to shoot in Australia. In October 2015, Steve-O said that the film was \\\"unlikely\\\" to happen and that the production would depend on Margera becoming and remaining sober. Jason \\\"Wee Man\\\" Acuna said in February 2018 that a fourth movie is \\\"definitely not happening\\\", though McGhehey said he believes the franchise will continue.\\n\\n\\n== Reception ==\\n\\n\\n=== Box office performance ===\\n\\n\\n=== Critical and public response ===\\n\\n\\n== Video game ==\\n\\nJackass: The Game was released on October 2, 2007. It was developed under a license by Sidhe Interactive in Wellington, New Zealand for the PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable and Nintendo DS. The game was first shown at the 2006 E3 behind closed doors. It is mentioned in the Jackass: Number Two commentary that the stunt where several members get punched in the face by a spring-loaded boxing glove hidden behind a fake valentine on a wall had just come upstairs from shooting a promo for the video game. Johnny Knoxville and other members of the Jackass team also provided stunt ideas to the developer based on unused stunts from the show. A trailer and the cover art was released in June 2007 on the game's official website. All main characters of the show were featured as playable, except for Bam Margera, who was contractually obligated by Neversoft to appear in the Tony Hawk franchise, thus making him unable to appear in any other video game.\\n\\n\\n== Influence ==\\nVarious groups have created shows based on or similar to Jackass. These include:\\n\\nExtreme Duudsonit aka The Dudesons (which also started airing at 2000, although they had been filming their stunts ever since the 1990s)\\nDirty Sanchez aka Team Sanchez\\nNitro Circus\\nStankervision (a repackaged version of 'The DAMN!

He joined up with other like-minded artists who wrote lyrics and rebelled against their suburban surroundings. These included Shifty Shellshock of Crazy Town, Evidence and Scott Caan, son of James Caan. In 1991, a 14-year-old Maman and Scott Caan decided to become a duo named The Whooliganz. While rhyming at a party in L.A., they attracted the attention of B-Real of Cypress Hill. He invited the teens to join his crew, The Soul Assassins, which also included the groups House of Pain and Funkdoobiest. In 1993, the Whooliganz released their first single, \\\"Put Your Handz Up.\\\" The song received little radio airplay and their record label, Tommy Boy Records, decided to shelve their album. Rejected, Scott focused his creative energy on acting while Al became interested in process of making hip-hop beats.\\nDJ Muggs took Al under his wing and taught him how to use a sampler and mixing board. After helping to produce a few tracks for Cypress Hill, Al became the main producer for his childhood friend, Evidence and his group Dilated Peoples.\\nWhen Dilated Peoples debuted in 1998, they helped promote Maman as a key part of their sound. Alchemist also produced several tracks on the debut album Focused Daily by Defari, another Dilated and Alkaholik affiliate. In 1999, Muggs introduced Al to his good friends, the popular hip-hop group Mobb Deep. Al produced two songs for their Murda Muzik album. Impressed by his production skills and street smarts, Mobb Deep continued using his beats on all their subsequent albums.  As Alchemist's profile increased, he went on to produce for many of hip hop's most successful and prominent artists, such as Nas, Fat Joe, Jadakiss, Ghostface Killah and Snoop Dogg. He has also remixed songs for bands and artists in other genres such as Linkin Park and Morcheeba. Al stayed loyal to his old friends, continuing to produce for Dilated, Cypress Hill and Crazy Town. He also enjoys producing for lesser-known underground rappers, often giving them some of his best beats.\\nIn 2004, six years after his rapping career folded, The Alchemist put out his debut album, 1st Infantry. The album yielded the single \\\"Hold You Down\\\" (featuring Prodigy, Illa Ghee and Nina Sky), which hit number ninety-five on the Billboard Hot 100 in 2005.\\n\\n\\n=== Ras Kass feud ===\\nIn 1999, The Alchemist was set to produce three tracks for American rapper Ras Kass' then-upcoming album Van Gogh, which was scheduled for a late 2000 release at the time. One of the said tracks was \\\"Home Sweet Home\\\", which was to be the lead single for Ras Kass' album. After The Alchemist received the first half of the payment for the beat, he said Ras Kass' record label (Priority) was ignoring him. They later met up in August, at the Source Awards in Pasadena, California, where Alchemist informed Kass that he'd been showcasing the beat to other artists. Jadakiss would then go on to record \\\"We Gonna Make It\\\" over the same beat, on his 2001 release, Kiss Tha Game Goodbye. When Ras Kass took notice, he attempted to stop the release by releasing his version of the song on mixtapes, to no avail. This prompted Ras to diss Alchemist in freestyles and on a track from Van Gogh. Eventually the beef ended so he could concentrate on his legal problems but still cited a loss of respect for the producer. In an interview with www.hiphopgame.com, Ras admitted that he was being stubborn and refused to listen to what the Alchemist was trying to tell him. The two have since squashed the beef and Alchemist produced the song \\\"Past, Future, and Present\\\" and did the intro for the song that appeared on the 2006 mixtape Revenge of the Spit. In 2011, Ras Kass appeared (together with rapper Raekwon) on fellow rapper Evidence's album Cats & Dogs, on a song called \\\"The Red Carpet\\\", which was produced by The Alchemist.\\n\\n\\n=== Other projects ===\\nThe Alchemist is one of the music producers behind the 10th installment of Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars released by Rockstar Games. He was also on Tim Westwood TV, when Eminem, Royce Da 5'9\\\" and Mr. Porter freestyled. During an interview with Worldwide Conspiracy Radio, The Alchemist revealed he would be dropping a 2-part project with fellow west coast producer Oh No entitled Gangrene, the first to be released in July, the second in November, both on Decon. Alchemist was also the DJ for the Eminem set on the BBC1 chat-show Jonathan Ross on June 4, 2010.\\n\\n\\n=== Shady Records ===\\nAlchemist is Eminem's official DJ, since DJ Green Lantern departed from Shady Records in 2005 because of a dispute related to the feud of 50 Cent and Jadakiss. In 2006, Eminem released a collaboration album with Shady Records called Eminem Presents: The Re-Up. Since the Alchemist is his official DJ, he produced some of the tracks on the mixtape, as well as compiling the album in a mixtape fashion. On December 18, 2013, he was named the runner-up for producer of the year by HipHopDX.\\n\\n\\n== Collaboration Projects ==\\n\\\"Return of the Mac\\\" (2007)In 2007, the Alchemist and rapper Prodigy came together for a studio album titled Return of the Mac, that was released on March 27, 2007. The album was intended to be a mixtape serving as a prequel to Prodigy's next album, H.N.I.C. Pt. 2, but was released as a traditional album due to the unexpected level of quality of the record. The album features songs sampled from the Blaxploitation era.\\nReturn of the Mac debuted at number thirty-two on the Billboard 200, selling 27,000 copies in its first week. As of December 2007, the album has sold 130,000 copies. The album received notable critical acclaim, and is considered somewhat of a return to form for Prodigy, as many considered him to have \\\"fallen off\\\" after the 2001 Mobb Deep release Infamy. Return of the Mac was supported by three singles with music videos: \\\"Mac 10 Handle\\\", \\\"New York Shit\\\", and \\\"Stuck on You\\\".\\n\\n\\\"The Antidote\\\" (2009)In 2009, The Alchemist produced an entire mixtape with rapper Fashawn, called The Antidote.\\n\\\"Covert Coup\\\" (2011)The Alchemist and the rapper Curren$y came together for the mixtape Covert Coup, which was released April 20, 2011. The Alchemist produced the whole mixtape, and even released an instrumental version of it.\\nIt was rumored that the pair were going to release a sequel to the mixtape, titled \\\"Re-Conversationalize\\\", which was to be released on April 20, 2012, exactly one year after the first project was released, but this did not happen. In fact it was proven by Alchemist (in an interview) that it was all rumors created and developed by the internet.\\n\\\"No Idols\\\" (2012)In August 2013, The Alchemist produced Odd Future member Domo Genesis' mixtape, No Idols. The mixtape was critically acclaimed upon release and featured guest appearances by Prodigy, Earl Sweatshirt, Tyler The Creator, Action Bronson, Vince Staples, Freddie Gibbs, and SpaceGhostPurrp. It was later released on a limited edition vinyl.\\n\\\"Yacht Rock\\\" (2012)In October 2012, The Alchemist and 9Five Eyewear collaborated to a project with an Alchemist edition Sunglasses/Eyeglasses with a 12-minute vinyl with an execlusive mix produced by Alchemist, featuring Action Bronson, Roc Marciano, Oh No, Big Twins, Chuck Inglish and Blu. It was limited for 400 Pieces worldwide. on October 31, 2012, The Alchemist released the project for a free download, in 9Five's website. Later it was released on a limited edition vinyl.\\n\\\"Rare Chandeliers\\\"(2012)A project titled Rare Chandeliers, a collaboration between Alchemist and Action Bronson, was released on November 15, 2012 as a mixtape. Later an extended version was released, also for free. The mixtape featured guest appearances from Roc Marciano, Styles P, and Sean Price, among others.\\n\\\"360 Waves\\\" (2013)The Alchemist collaborated with the group Durag Dynasty (which are Planet Asia, TriState and Killer Ben) that also appeared on his album Russian Roulette, for their debut album 360 Waves. He produced the entire album. The album was released on March 26, after a first video for the first half of the song \\\"360 Waves\\\" was released a day before. Later, a video for the second single \\\"Fish Meat\\\" (featuring Prodigy) was released (on July 29) and a video for the second half of the song was released too (on August 19).\\n\\\"Albert Einstein\\\"(2013)Prodigy's second album with the Alchemist, Albert Einstein, was released on June 11, 2013; it featured guest appearances from Roc Marciano, Domo Genesis, Havoc, Raekwon and Action Bronson.

The California Gold Rush starting in 1848 led to dramatic social and demographic changes, with large-scale emigration from the east and abroad with an accompanying economic boom.\\n\\n\\n== Etymology ==\\n\\nThe word California originally referred to the Baja California Peninsula of Mexico; it was later extended to the entire region composed of the current United States states of California, Nevada, and Utah, and parts of Arizona, New Mexico, Texas and Wyoming.Spanish explorer Francisco de Ulloa's initial surveys of the Baja California Peninsula exploring the western coast of North America led him to believe that it was an island rather than part of the larger continent. The name likely derived from the mythical island California in the fictional story of Queen Calafia, as recorded in a 1510 work The Adventures of Esplandian by Garci Rodriguez de Montalvo. This work was the fifth in a popular Spanish chivalric romance series that began with Amadis de Gaula. Queen Calafia's kingdom was said to be a remote land rich in gold and pearls, inhabited by beautiful black women who wore gold armor and lived like Amazons, as well as griffins and other strange beasts. In the fictional paradise, the ruler Queen Calafia fought alongside Muslims and her name may have been chosen to echo the title of a Muslim leader, the Caliph. It's possible the name California was meant to imply the island was a Caliphate.\\nKnow ye that at the right hand of the Indies there is an island called California, very close to that part of the Terrestrial Paradise, which was inhabited by black women without a single man among them, and they lived in the manner of Amazons. They were robust of body with strong passionate hearts and great virtue. The island itself is one of the wildest in the world on account of the bold and craggy rocks. \\n\\nThe conventional wisdom that California was an island, with maps drawn to reflect this belief, lasted as late as the 18th century.Shortened forms of the state's name include CA, Cal., Calif., and US-CA.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\n\\n=== The first inhabitants ===\\nSettled by successive waves of arrivals during the last 10,000 years, California was one of the most culturally and linguistically diverse areas in pre-Columbian North America. Various estimates of the native population range from 100,000 to 300,000. The Indigenous peoples of California included more than 70 distinct groups of Native Americans, ranging from large, settled populations living on the coast to groups in the interior. California groups also were diverse in their political organization with bands, tribes, villages, and on the resource-rich coasts, large chiefdoms, such as the Chumash, Pomo and Salinan. Trade, intermarriage and military alliances fostered many social and economic relationships among the diverse groups.\\n\\n\\n=== Colonial and Spanish periods ===\\n\\nThe first European effort to explore the coast as far north as the Russian River was a Spanish sailing expedition, led by Portuguese captain Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo, in 1542. Some 37 years later English explorer Francis Drake also explored and claimed an undefined portion of the California coast in 1579. Spanish traders made unintended visits with the Manila galleons on their return trips from the Philippines beginning in 1565. The first Asians to set foot on what would be the United States occurred in 1587, when Filipino sailors arrived in Spanish ships at Morro Bay. Sebastian Vizcaino explored and mapped the coast of California in 1602 for New Spain.\\nDespite the on-the-ground explorations of California in the 16th century, Rodriguez's idea of California as an island persisted. That depiction appeared on many European maps well into the 18th century.After the Portola expedition of 1769-70, Spanish missionaries began setting up 21 California Missions on or near the coast of Alta (Upper) California, beginning in San Diego. During the same period, Spanish military forces built several forts (presidios) and three small towns (pueblos). The San Francisco Mission grew into the city of San Francisco, and two of the pueblos grew into the cities of Los Angeles and San Jose. Several other smaller cities and towns also sprang up surrounding the various Spanish missions and pueblos, which remain to this day.\\nThe Spanish colonization began the genocide of the indigenous Californian peoples, decimating their numbers through epidemics of various diseases for which the indigenous peoples had no natural immunity, such as measles and diphtheria.  The establishment of the Spanish systems of government and social structure, which the Spanish settlers had brought with them, also technologically and culturally overwhelmed the societies of the earlier indigenous peoples.\\nDuring this same period, Russian ships also explored along the California coast and in 1812 established a trading post at Fort Ross. Russia's early 19th-century coastal settlements in California were positioned just north of the northernmost edge of the area of Spanish settlement in San Francisco Bay, and were the southernmost Russian settlements in North America.   The Russian settlements associated with Fort Ross were spread over an area stretching from Point Arena to Tomales Bay.\\n\\n\\n=== California under Mexican rule ===\\n\\nIn 1821, the Mexican War of Independence gave Mexico (including California) independence from Spain.  For the next 25 years, Alta California remained as a remote, sparsely populated, northwestern administrative district of the newly independent country of Mexico.\\nCattle ranches, or ranchos, emerged as the dominant institutions of Mexican California. Soon after Mexican independence from Spain, the chain of missions became the property of the Mexican government and was secularized by 1834. The ranchos developed under ownership by Californios (Spanish-speaking Californians) who had received land grants, and traded cowhides and tallow with Boston merchants.\\nFrom the 1820s, trappers and settlers from the United States and the future Canada arrived in Northern California. These new arrivals used the Siskiyou Trail, California Trail, Oregon Trail and Old Spanish Trail to cross the rugged mountains and harsh deserts in and surrounding California.\\nThe early government of the newly independent Mexico was highly unstable, and in a reflection of this, from 1831 onwards, California also experienced a series of armed disputes, both between regional areas, and also revolts against the central Mexican government. During this tumultuous political period Juan Bautista Alvarado was able to secure the governorship from 1836 - 1842. The military action which first brought Alvarado to power had momentarily declared California to be an independent state, and had been aided by American and British residents of California, including Isaac Graham. In 1840, one hundred of those residents who did not have passports were arrested, leading to the Graham affair.One of the largest ranchers in California was John Marsh. After failing to obtain justice against squatters on his land from the Mexican courts, he determined that California should become part of the United States. Marsh conducted a letter-writing campaign espousing the California climate, soil and other reasons to settle there, as well as the best route to follow, which became known as \\\"Marsh's route.\\\" His letters were read, reread, passed around, and printed in newspapers throughout the country, and started the first wagon trains rolling to California.  He invited immigrants to stay on his ranch until they could get settled, and assisted in their obtaining passports.After ushering in the period of organized emigration to California, Marsh helped end the rule of the last Mexican governor of California, thereby paving the way to California's ultimate acquisition by the United States.\\n\\n\\n=== California Republic and American invasion ===\\n\\nIn 1846, a group of American settlers in and around Sonoma rebelled against Mexican rule during the Bear Flag Revolt. Afterwards, rebels raised the Bear Flag (featuring a bear, a star, a red stripe and the words \\\"California Republic\\\") at Sonoma. The Republic's only president was William B. Ide, who played a pivotal role during the Bear Flag Revolt.  This revolt by American settlers served as a prelude to the later American military invasion of California, and was closely coordinated with nearby American military commanders.\\nThe California Republic was short lived; the same year marked the outbreak of the Mexican-American War (1846-48). When Commodore John D. Sloat of the United States Navy sailed into Monterey Bay and began the military occupation of California by the United States, Northern California capitulated in less than a month to the United States forces. After a series of defensive battles in Southern California, the Treaty of Cahuenga was signed by the Californios on January 13, 1847, securing American control in California.\\n\\n\\n=== Early American statehood period ===\\n\\nFollowing the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo (February 2, 1848) that ended the war, the westernmost portion of the old Mexican territory of Alta California soon became the American state of California, and the remainder of the old territory was then subdivided into the new American Territories of Arizona, Nevada, Colorado and Utah. The lightly populated and arid lower region of old Baja California remained as a part of Mexico. In 1846, the total settler population of the western part of the old Alta California had been estimated to be no more than 8,000, plus about 100,000 Native Americans, down from about 300,000 before Hispanic settlement in 1769.In 1848, only one week before the official American annexation of the area, gold was discovered in California, this being an event which was to forever alter both the state's demographics and its finances.  Soon afterward, a massive influx of immigration into the area resulted, as prospectors and miners arrived by the thousands.  The population burgeoned with United States citizens, Europeans, Chinese and other immigrants during the great California Gold Rush. By the time of California's application to the US Congress for statehood in 1850, the settler population of California had multiplied to 100,000.  By 1854 over 300,000 settlers had come. Between 1847 and 1870, the population of San Francisco increased from 500 to 150,000. California was suddenly no longer a sparsely populated backwater, but seemingly overnight it had grown into a major US population center.\\nThe seat of government for California under Spanish and later Mexican rule had been located in Monterey from 1777 until 1845. Pio Pico, last Mexican governor of Alta California, had briefly moved the capital to Los Angeles in 1845. The United States consulate had also been located in Monterey, under consul Thomas O. Larkin.\\nIn 1849, a state Constitutional Convention was first held in Monterey. Among the first tasks of the Convention was a decision on a location for the new state capital. The first full legislative sessions were held in San Jose (1850-1851). Subsequent locations included Vallejo (1852-1853), and nearby Benicia (1853-1854); these locations eventually proved to be inadequate as well. The capital has been located in Sacramento since 1854 with only a short break in 1862 when legislative sessions were held in San Francisco due to flooding in Sacramento.\\nOnce the state's Constitutional Convention had finalized its state constitution, it applied to the US Congress for admission to statehood.  On September 9, 1850, as part of the Compromise of 1850, California was officially admitted into the United States as an undivided free state.  Its status as a 'free state' prevented the expansion of slavery to the Pacific Coast, which was a foremost concern for the pre-Civil War US Congress. Within the state of California, Sep 9 remains as an annually celebrated legal holiday known as California Admission Day.\\nDuring the American Civil War (1861-1865), California was able to send gold shipments eastwards to Washington in support of the Union cause; however, due to the existence of a large contingent of pro-South sympathizers within the state, the state was not able to muster any full military regiments to send eastwards to officially serve in the Union war effort.  Still, several smaller military units within the Union army were unofficially associated with the state of California, such as the \\\"California 100 Company\\\", due to a majority of their members being from California.\\nAt the time of California's admission into the Union, travel between California and the rest of the continental United States had been a time consuming and dangerous feat.  Nineteen years afterwards, in 1869, shortly after the conclusion of the Civil War,   a more direct connection was developed with the completion of the First Transcontinental Railroad in 1869. California was then easy to reach.\\nMuch of the state was extremely well suited to fruit cultivation and agriculture in general. Vast expanses of wheat, other cereal crops, vegetable crops, cotton, and nut and fruit trees were grown (including oranges in Southern California), and the foundation was laid for the state's prodigious agricultural production in the Central Valley and elsewhere.\\n\\n\\n==== Indigenous peoples under early American administration ====\\n\\nUnder earlier Spanish and Mexican rule, California's original native population had precipitously declined, above all, from Eurasian diseases to which the indigenous people of California had not yet developed a natural immunity. Under its new American administration, California's harsh governmental policies towards its own indigenous people did not improve.  As in other American states, many of the native inhabitants were soon forcibly removed from their lands by incoming American settlers such as miners, ranchers, and farmers. Although California had entered the American union as a free state, the \\\"loitering or orphaned Indians\\\" were de facto enslaved by their new Anglo-American masters under the 1853 Act for the Government and Protection of Indians. There were also massacres in which hundreds of indigenous people were killed.\\nBetween 1850 and 1860, the California state government paid around 1.5 million dollars (some 250,000 of which was reimbursed by the federal government) to hire militias whose purpose was to protect settlers from the indigenous populations. In later decades, the native population was placed in reservations and rancherias, which were often small and isolated and without enough natural resources or funding from the government to sustain the populations living on them. As a result, the rise of California was a calamity for the native inhabitants. Several scholars and Native American activists, including Benjamin Madley and Ed Castillo, have described the actions of the California government as a genocide.\\n\\n\\n=== 20th century ===\\n\\nMigration to California accelerated during the early 20th century with the completion of major transcontinental highways like the Lincoln Highway and Route 66. In the period from 1900 to 1965, the population grew from fewer than one million to the greatest in the Union. In 1940, the Census Bureau reported California's population as 6.0% Hispanic, 2.4% Asian, and 89.5% non-Hispanic white.To meet the population's needs, major engineering feats like the California and Los Angeles Aqueducts; the Oroville and Shasta Dams; and the Bay and Golden Gate Bridges were built across the state. The state government also adopted the California Master Plan for Higher Education in 1960 to develop a highly efficient system of public education.\\nMeanwhile, attracted to the mild Mediterranean climate, cheap land, and the state's wide variety of geography, filmmakers established the studio system in Hollywood in the 1920s. California manufactured 8.7 percent of total United States military armaments produced during World War II, ranking third (behind New York and Michigan) among the 48 states. California however easily ranked first in production of military ships during the war (transport, cargo, [merchant ships] such as  Liberty ships, Victory ships, and warships) at drydock facilities in San Diego, Los Angeles, and the San Francisco Bay Area. After World War II, California's economy greatly expanded due to strong aerospace and defense industries, whose size decreased following the end of the Cold War. Stanford University and its Dean of Engineering Frederick Terman began encouraging faculty and graduates to stay in California instead of leaving the state, and develop a high-tech region in the area now known as Silicon Valley. As a result of these efforts, California is regarded as a world center of the entertainment and music industries, of technology, engineering, and the aerospace industry, and as the United States center of agricultural production. Just before the Dot Com Bust, California had the fifth-largest economy in the world among nations. Yet since 1991, and starting in the late 1980s in Southern California, California has seen a net loss of domestic migrants in most years. This is often referred to by the media as the California exodus.During the 20th century, two great disasters happened in California. The 1906 San Francisco earthquake and 1928 St. Francis Dam flood remain the deadliest in U.S history.\\n\\n\\n== Geography ==\\n\\nCalifornia is the 3rd largest state in the United States in area, after Alaska and Texas.  California is often geographically bisected into two regions, Southern California, comprising the 10 southernmost counties, and Northern California, comprising the 48 northernmost counties. It is bordered by Oregon to the north, Nevada to the east and northeast, Arizona to the southeast, the Pacific Ocean to the west and it shares an international border with the Mexican state of Baja California to the south (with which it makes up part of The Californias region of North America, alongside Baja California Sur).\\nIn the middle of the state lies the California Central Valley, bounded by the Sierra Nevada in the east, the coastal mountain ranges in the west, the Cascade Range to the north and by the Tehachapi Mountains in the south. The Central Valley is California's productive agricultural heartland.\\nDivided in two by the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta, the northern portion, the Sacramento Valley serves as the watershed of the Sacramento River, while the southern portion, the San Joaquin Valley is the watershed for the San Joaquin River. Both valleys derive their names from the rivers that flow through them. With dredging, the Sacramento and the San Joaquin Rivers have remained deep enough for several inland cities to be seaports.\\nThe Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta is a critical water supply hub for the state. Water is diverted from the delta and through an extensive network of pumps and canals that traverse nearly the length of the state, to the Central Valley and the State Water Projects and other needs. Water from the Delta provides drinking water for nearly 23 million people, almost two-thirds of the state's population as well as water for farmers on the west side of the San Joaquin Valley.\\nSuisun Bay lies at the confluence of the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers. The water is drained by the Carquinez Strait, which flows into San Pablo Bay, a northern extension of San Francisco Bay, which then connects to the Pacific Ocean via the Golden Gate strait.\\nThe Channel Islands are located off the Southern coast, while the Farallon Islands lie west of San Francisco.\\nThe Sierra Nevada (Spanish for \\\"snowy range\\\") includes the highest peak in the contiguous 48 states, Mount Whitney, at 14,505 feet (4,421 m). The range embraces Yosemite Valley, famous for its glacially carved domes, and Sequoia National Park, home to the giant sequoia trees, the largest living organisms on Earth, and the deep freshwater lake, Lake Tahoe, the largest lake in the state by volume.\\nTo the east of the Sierra Nevada are Owens Valley and Mono Lake, an essential migratory bird habitat. In the western part of the state is Clear Lake, the largest freshwater lake by area entirely in California. Though Lake Tahoe is larger, it is divided by the California/Nevada border. The Sierra Nevada falls to Arctic temperatures in winter and has several dozen small glaciers, including Palisade Glacier, the southernmost glacier in the United States.\\nAbout 45 percent of the state's total surface area is covered by forests, and California's diversity of pine species is unmatched by any other state. California contains more forestland than any other state except Alaska. Many of the trees in the California White Mountains are the oldest in the world; an individual bristlecone pine is over 5,000 years old.In the south is a large inland salt lake, the Salton Sea. The south-central desert is called the Mojave; to the northeast of the Mojave lies Death Valley, which contains the lowest and hottest place in North America, the Badwater Basin at -279 feet (-85 m).  The horizontal distance from the bottom of Death Valley to the top of Mount Whitney is less than 90 miles (140 km). Indeed, almost all of southeastern California is arid, hot desert, with routine extreme high temperatures during the summer. The southeastern border of California with Arizona is entirely formed by the Colorado River, from which the southern part of the state gets about half of its water.\\nA majority of California's cities are located in either the San Francisco Bay Area or the Sacramento metropolitan area in Northern California; or the Los Angeles area, the Riverside-San Bernardino-Inland Empire, or the San Diego metropolitan area in Southern California. The Los Angeles Area, the Bay Area, and the San Diego metropolitan area are among several major metropolitan areas along the California coast.\\nAs part of the Ring of Fire, California is subject to tsunamis, floods, droughts, Santa Ana winds, wildfires, landslides on steep terrain, and has several volcanoes. It has many earthquakes due to several faults running through the state, in particular, the San Andreas Fault. About 37,000 earthquakes are recorded each year, but most are too small to be felt.\\n\\n\\n=== Climate ===\\n\\nAlthough most of the state has a Mediterranean climate, due to the state's large size, the climate ranges from polar to subtropical. The cool California Current offshore often creates summer fog near the coast. Farther inland, there are colder winters and hotter summers. The maritime moderation results in the shoreline summertime temperatures of Los Angeles and San Francisco being the coolest of all major metropolitan areas of the United States and uniquely cool compared to areas on the same latitude in the interior and on the east coast of the North American continent. Even the San Diego shoreline bordering Mexico is cooler in summer than most areas in the contiguous United States. Just a few miles inland, summer temperature extremes are significantly higher, with downtown Los Angeles being several degrees warmer than at the coast. The same microclimate phenomenon is seen in the climate of the Bay Area, where areas sheltered from the sea experience significantly hotter summers than nearby areas that are close to the ocean.\\nNorthern parts of the state have more rain than the south. California's mountain ranges also influence the climate: some of the rainiest parts of the state are west-facing mountain slopes. Northwestern California has a temperate climate, and the Central Valley has a Mediterranean climate but with greater temperature extremes than the coast. The high mountains, including the Sierra Nevada, have an alpine climate with snow in winter and mild to moderate heat in summer.\\nCalifornia's mountains produce rain shadows on the eastern side, creating extensive deserts. The higher elevation deserts of eastern California have hot summers and cold winters, while the low deserts east of the Southern California mountains have hot summers and nearly frostless mild winters. Death Valley, a desert with large expanses below sea level, is considered the hottest location in the world; the highest temperature in the world, 134 degF (56.7 degC), was recorded there on July 10, 1913. The lowest temperature in California was -45 degF (-43 degC) in 1937 in Boca.\\nThe table below lists average temperatures for January and August in a selection of places throughout the state; some highly populated and some not. This includes the relatively cool summers of the Humboldt Bay region around Eureka, the extreme heat of Death Valley, and the mountain climate of Mammoth in the Sierra Nevadas.\\n\\n\\n=== Ecology ===\\n\\nCalifornia is one of the richest and most diverse parts of the world, and includes some of the most endangered ecological communities. California is part of the Nearctic ecozone and spans a number of terrestrial ecoregions.California's large number of endemic species includes relict species, which have died out elsewhere, such as the Catalina ironwood (Lyonothamnus floribundus). Many other endemics originated through differentiation or adaptive radiation, whereby multiple species develop from a common ancestor to take advantage of diverse ecological conditions such as the California lilac (Ceanothus). Many California endemics have become endangered, as urbanization, logging, overgrazing, and the introduction of exotic species have encroached on their habitat.\\n\\n\\n=== Flora and fauna ===\\n\\nCalifornia boasts several superlatives in its collection of flora: the largest trees, the tallest trees, and the oldest trees. California's native grasses are perennial plants. After European contact, these were generally replaced by invasive species of European annual grasses; and, in modern times, California's hills turn a characteristic golden-brown in summer.Because California has the greatest diversity of climate and terrain, the state has six life zones which are the lower Sonoran (desert); upper Sonoran (foothill regions and some coastal lands), transition (coastal areas and moist northeastern counties); and the Canadian, Hudsonian, and Arctic Zones, comprising the state's highest elevations.Plant life in the dry climate of the lower Sonoran zone contains a diversity of native cactus, mesquite, and paloverde. The Joshua tree is found in the Mojave Desert. Flowering plants include the dwarf desert poppy and a variety of asters. Fremont cottonwood and valley oak thrive in the Central Valley. The upper Sonoran zone includes the chaparral belt, characterized by forests of small shrubs, stunted trees, and herbaceous plants. Nemophila, mint, Phacelia, Viola, and the California poppy (Eschscholzia californica) - the state flower - also flourish in this zone, along with the lupine, more species of which occur here than anywhere else in the world.The transition zone includes most of California's forests with the redwood (Sequoia sempervirens) and the \\\"big tree\\\" or giant sequoia (Sequoiadendron giganteum), among the oldest living things on earth (some are said to have lived at least 4,000 years). Tanbark oak, California laurel, sugar pine, madrona, broad-leaved maple, and Douglas-fir also grow here. Forest floors are covered with swordfern, alumnroot, barrenwort, and trillium, and there are thickets of huckleberry, azalea, elder, and wild currant. Characteristic wild flowers include varieties of mariposa, tulip, and tiger and leopard lilies.The high elevations of the Canadian zone allow the Jeffrey pine, red fir, and lodgepole pine to thrive. Brushy areas are abundant with dwarf manzanita and ceanothus; the unique Sierra puffball is also found here. Right below the timberline, in the Hudsonian zone, the whitebark, foxtail, and silver pines grow. At about 10,500 feet (3,200 m), begins the Arctic zone, a treeless region whose flora include a number of wildflowers, including Sierra primrose, yellow columbine, alpine buttercup, and alpine shooting star.Common plants that have been introduced to the state include the eucalyptus, acacia, pepper tree, geranium, and Scotch broom. The species that are federally classified as endangered are the Contra Costa wallflower, Antioch Dunes evening primrose, Solano grass, San Clemente Island larkspur, salt marsh bird's beak, McDonald's rock-cress, and Santa Barbara Island liveforever. As of  December 1997, 85 plant species were listed as threatened or endangered.In the deserts of the lower Sonoran zone, the mammals include the jackrabbit, kangaroo rat, squirrel, and opossum. Common birds include the owl, roadrunner, cactus wren, and various species of hawk. The area's reptilian life include the sidewinder viper, desert tortoise, and horned toad. The upper Sonoran zone boasts mammals such as the antelope, brown-footed woodrat, and ring-tailed cat. Birds unique to this zone are the California thrasher, bushtit, and California condor.In the transition zone, there are Colombian black-tailed deer, black bears, gray foxes, cougars, bobcats, and Roosevelt elk. Reptiles such as the garter snakes and rattlesnakes inhabit the zone. In addition, amphibians such as the water puppy and redwood salamander are common too. Birds such as the kingfisher, chickadee, towhee, and hummingbird thrive here as well.The Canadian zone mammals include the mountain weasel, snowshoe hare, and several species of chipmunks. Conspicuous birds include the blue-fronted jay, Sierra chickadee. Sierra hermit thrush, water ouzel, and Townsend's solitaire. As one ascends into the Hudsonian zone, birds become scarcer. While the Sierra rosy finch is the only bird native to the high Arctic region, other bird species such as the hummingbird and Clark's nutcracker. Principal mammals found in this region include the Sierra coney, white-tailed jackrabbit, and the bighorn sheep. As of  April 2003, the bighorn sheep was listed as endangered by the US Fish and Wildlife Service. The fauna found throughout several zones are the mule deer, coyote, mountain lion, northern flicker, and several species of hawk and sparrow.Aquatic life in California thrives, from the state's mountain lakes and streams to the rocky Pacific coastline. Numerous trout species are found, among them rainbow, golden, and cutthroat. Migratory species of salmon are common as well. Deep-sea life forms include sea bass, yellowfin tuna, barracuda, and several types of whale. Native to the cliffs of northern California are seals, sea lions, and many types of shorebirds, including migratory species.As of April 2003, 118 California animals were on the federal endangered list; 181 plants were listed as endangered or threatened. Endangered animals include the San Joaquin kitfox, Point Arena mountain beaver, Pacific pocket mouse, salt marsh harvest mouse, Morro Bay kangaroo rat (and five other species of kangaroo rat), Amargosa vole, California least tern, California condor, loggerhead shrike, San Clemente sage sparrow, San Francisco garter snake, five species of salamander, three species of chub, and two species of pupfish. Eleven butterflies are also endangered and two that are threatened are on the federal list. Among threatened animals are the coastal California gnatcatcher, Paiute cutthroat trout, southern sea otter, and northern spotted owl. California has a total of 290,821 acres (1,176.91 km2) of National Wildlife Refuges. As of  September 2010, 123 California animals were listed as either endangered or threatened on the federal list provided by the US Fish & Wildlife Service. Also, as of the same year, 178 species of California plants were listed either as endangered or threatened on this federal list.\\n\\n\\n=== Rivers ===\\n\\nThe vast majority of rivers in California are dammed as part of two massive water projects: the Central Valley Project, providing water to the agricultural Central Valley, and the California State Water Project diverting water from northern to southern California. The state's coasts, rivers, and other bodies of water are regulated by the California Coastal Commission.\\nThe two most prominent rivers within California are the Sacramento River and the San Joaquin River, which drain the Central Valley and the west slope of the Sierra Nevada and flow to the Pacific Ocean through San Francisco Bay. Several major tributaries feed into the Sacramento and the San Joaquin, including the Pit River, the Tuolumne River, and the Feather River.\\nThe Eel River and Salinas River each drain portions of the California coast, north and south of San Francisco Bay, respectively, and the Eel River is the largest river in the state to remain in its natural un-dammed state. The Mojave River is the primary watercourse in the Mojave Desert, and the Santa Ana River drains much of the Transverse Ranges as it bisects Southern California. Some other important rivers are the Klamath River and the Trinity River in the far north coast, and the Colorado River on the southeast border with Arizona.\\n\\n\\n=== Regions ===\\n\\n\\n== Demography ==\\n\\n\\n=== Population ===\\n\\nThe United States Census Bureau estimates that the population of California was 39,250,017 on July 1, 2016, a 5.4% increase since the 2010 United States Census. The population is projected to reach 40 million by 2018 and 50 million by 2055.Between 2000 and 2009, there was a natural increase of 3,090,016 (5,058,440 births minus 2,179,958 deaths). During this time period, international migration produced a net increase of 1,816,633 people while domestic migration produced a net decrease of 1,509,708, resulting in a net in-migration of 306,925 people. The state of California's own statistics show a population of 38,292,687 for January 1, 2009. However, according to the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research, since 1990 almost 3.4 million Californians have moved to other states, with most leaving to Texas, Nevada, and Arizona.California is the 2nd-most populous subnational entity in the Western Hemisphere and the Americas, with a population second to that of the state of Sao Paulo in Brazil. California's population is greater than that of all but 34 countries of the world. The Greater Los Angeles Area is the 2nd-largest metropolitan area in the United States, after the New York metropolitan area, while Los Angeles, with nearly half the population of New York City, is the second-largest city in the United States. Also, Los Angeles County has held the title of most populous United States county for decades, and it alone is more populous than 42 United States states. Including Los Angeles, four of the top 15 most populous cities in the U.S. are in California: Los Angeles (2nd), San Diego (8th), San Jose (10th), and San Francisco (13th). The center of population of California is located in the town of Buttonwillow, Kern County.\\n\\n\\n=== Cities and towns ===\\n\\nThe state has 482 incorporated cities and towns, of which 460 are cities and 22 are towns. Under California law, the terms \\\"city\\\" and \\\"town\\\" are explicitly interchangeable; the name of an incorporated municipality in the state can either be \\\"City of (Name)\\\" or \\\"Town of (Name)\\\".Sacramento became California's first incorporated city on February 27, 1850. San Jose, San Diego and Benicia tied for California's second incorporated city, each receiving incorporation on March 27, 1850. Jurupa Valley became the state's most recent and 482nd incorporated municipality on July 1, 2011.The majority of these cities and towns are within one of five metropolitan areas: the Los Angeles Metropolitan Area, the San Francisco Bay Area, the Riverside-San Bernardino Area, the San Diego metropolitan area, or the Sacramento metropolitan area.\\n\\n\\n==== Migration ====\\nStarting in the year 2010, for the first time since the California Gold Rush, California-born residents make up the majority of the state's population. Along with the rest of the United States, California's immigration pattern has also shifted over the course of the late 2000s-early 2010s. Immigration from Latin American countries has dropped significantly with most immigrants now coming from Asia. In total for 2011, there were 277,304 immigrants. 57% came from Asian countries vs. 22% from Latin American countries. Net immigration from Mexico, previously the most common country of origin for new immigrants, has dropped to zero/less than zero since more Mexican nationals are departing for their home country than immigrating. As a result it is projected that Hispanic citizens will constitute 49% of the population by 2060, instead of the previously projected 2050, due primarily to domestic births.The state's population of undocumented immigrants has been shrinking in recent years, due to increased enforcement and decreased job opportunities for lower-skilled workers. The number of migrants arrested attempting to cross the Mexican border in the Southwest decreased from a high of 1.1 million in 2005 to 367,000 in 2011. Despite these recent trends, illegal aliens constituted an estimated 7.3 percent of the state's population, the third highest percentage of any state in the country, totaling nearly 2.6 million. In particular, illegal immigrants tended to be concentrated in Los Angeles, Monterey, San Benito, Imperial, and Napa Counties - the latter four of which have significant agricultural industries that depend on manual labor. More than half of illegal immigrants originate from Mexico.\\n\\n\\n=== National origins ===\\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau in 2016 the population self-identifies as (alone or in combination):\\n72.7% White (including Non-Hispanic whites/Anglos and Hispanics)\\n14.8% Asian\\n6.5% Black or African American\\n3.8% Two or More Races\\n1.7% Native American and Alaska Native\\n0.5% Native Hawaiian or Pacific IslanderBy ethnicity, in 2016 the population was 61.1% non-Hispanic (of any race) and 38.9% Hispanic or Latino (of any race). Non-Hispanic whites constituted 37.7% of the state's population. Californios are the Hispanic residents native to California, who are culturally or genetically descended from the Spanish-speaking community which has existed in California since 1542, of varying Mexican American/Chicano, Criollo Spaniard, and Mestizo origin.As of 2011, 75.1% of California's population younger than age 1 were minorities, meaning that they had at least one parent who was not non-Hispanic white (white Hispanics are counted as minorities).In terms of total numbers, California has the largest population of White Americans in the United States, an estimated 22,200,000 residents. The state has the 5th largest population of African Americans in the United States, an estimated 2,250,000 residents. California's Asian American population is estimated at 4.4 million, constituting a third of the nation's total. California's Native American population of 285,000 is the most of any state.According to estimates from 2011, California has the largest minority population in the United States by numbers, making up 60% of the state population. Over the past 25 years, the population of non-Hispanic whites has declined, while Hispanic and Asian populations have grown. Between 1970 and 2011, non-Hispanic whites declined from 80% of the state's population to 40%, while Hispanics grew from 32% in 2000 to 38% in 2011. It is currently projected that Hispanics will rise to 49% of the population by 2060, primarily due to domestic births rather than immigration. With the decline of immigration from Latin America, Asian Americans now constitute the fastest growing racial/ethnic group in California; this growth is primarily driven by immigration from China, India and the Philippines, respectively.\\n\\n\\n=== Languages ===\\nEnglish serves as California's de jure and de facto official language. In 2010, the Modern Language Association of America estimated that 57.02% (19,429,309) of California residents age 5 and older spoke only English at home, while 42.98% spoke another primary language at home. According to the 2007 American Community Survey, 73% of people who speak a language other than English at home are able to speak English well or very well, with 9.8% not speaking English at all. Like most U.S. states (32 out of 50), California law enshrines English as its official language, and has done so since the passage of Proposition 63 by California voters. Various government agencies do, and are often required to, furnish documents in the various languages needed to reach their intended audiences.In total, 16 languages other than English were spoken as primary languages at home by more than 100,000 persons, more than any other state in the nation. New York State, in second place, had 9 languages other than English spoken by more than 100,000 persons. The most common language spoken besides English was Spanish, spoken by 28.46% (9,696,638) of the population. With Asia contributing most of California's new immigrants, California had the highest concentration nationwide of Vietnamese and Chinese speakers, the second highest concentration of Korean, and the third highest concentration of Tagalog speakers.California has historically been one of the most linguistically diverse areas in the world, with more than 70 indigenous languages derived from 64 root languages in 6 language families. A survey conducted between 2007 and 2009 identified 23 different indigenous languages of Mexico that are spoken among California farmworkers. All of California's indigenous languages are endangered, although there are now efforts toward language revitalization.As a result of the state's increasing diversity and migration from other areas across the country and around the globe, linguists began noticing a noteworthy set of emerging characteristics of spoken American English in California since the late 20th century. This variety, known as California English, has a vowel shift and several other phonological processes that are different from varieties of American\\nEnglish used in other regions of the United States.\\n\\n\\n== Culture ==\\n\\nThe culture of California is a Western culture and most clearly has its modern roots in the culture of the United States, but also, historically, many Hispanic Californio and Mexican influences. As a border and coastal state, Californian culture has been greatly influenced by several large immigrant populations, especially those from Latin America and Asia.California has long been a subject of interest in the public mind and has often been promoted by its boosters as a kind of paradise. In the early 20th century, fueled by the efforts of state and local boosters, many Americans saw the Golden State as an ideal resort destination, sunny and dry all year round with easy access to the ocean and mountains. In the 1960s, popular music groups such as The Beach Boys promoted the image of Californians as laid-back, tanned beach-goers.\\nThe California Gold Rush of the 1850s is still seen as a symbol of California's economic style, which tends to generate technology, social, entertainment, and economic fads and booms and related busts.\\n\\n\\n=== Religion ===\\n\\nThe largest religious denominations by number of adherents as a percentage of California's population in 2014 were the Catholic Church with 28 percent, Evangelical Protestants with 20 percent, and Mainline Protestants with 10 percent. Together, all kinds of Protestants accounted for 32 percent. Those unaffiliated with any religion represented 27 percent of the population. The breakdown of other religions is 1% Muslim, 2% Hindu and 2% Buddhist. This is a change from 2008, when the population identified their religion with the Catholic Church with 31 percent; Evangelical Protestants with 18 percent; and Mainline Protestants with 14 percent. In 2008, those unaffiliated with any religion represented 21 percent of the population. The breakdown of other religions in 2008 was 0.5% Muslim, 1% Hindu and 2% Buddhist. The American Jewish Year Book placed the total Jewish population of California at about 1,194,190 in 2006. According to the Association of Religion Data Archives (ARDA) the largest denominations by adherents in 2010 were the Roman Catholic Church with 10,233,334; The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints with 763,818; and the Southern Baptist Convention with 489,953.The first priests to come to California were Roman Catholic missionaries from Spain. Roman Catholics founded 21 missions along the California coast, as well as the cities of Los Angeles and San Francisco. California continues to have a large Roman Catholic population due to the large numbers of Mexicans and Central Americans living within its borders. California has twelve dioceses and two archdioceses, the Archdiocese of Los Angeles and the Archdiocese of San Francisco, the former being the largest archdiocese in the United States.\\nA Pew Research Center survey revealed that California is somewhat less religious than the rest of the US: 62 percent of Californians say they are \\\"absolutely certain\\\" of their belief in God, while in the nation 71 percent say so. The survey also revealed 48 percent of Californians say religion is \\\"very important\\\", compared to 56 percent nationally.\\n\\n\\n=== Sports ===\\n\\nCalifornia has twenty major professional sports league franchises, far more than any other state. The San Francisco Bay Area has seven major league teams spread in its three major cities: San Francisco, San Jose, and Oakland. While the Greater Los Angeles Area is home to ten major league franchises. San Diego and Sacramento each have one major league team. The NFL Super Bowl has been hosted in California 11 times at four different stadiums: Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, the Rose Bowl, Stanford Stadium, and San Diego's Qualcomm Stadium. A twelfth, Super Bowl 50, was held at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara on February 7, 2016.California has long had many respected collegiate sports programs. California is home to the oldest college bowl game, the annual Rose Bowl, among others.\\nCalifornia is the only U.S. state to have hosted both the Summer and Winter Olympics. The 1932 and 1984 Summer Olympics were held in Los Angeles. Squaw Valley Ski Resort in the Lake Tahoe region hosted the 1960 Winter Olympics. Los Angeles will host the 2028 Summer Olympics, marking the fourth time California hosts the Olympic Games. Multiple games during the 1994 FIFA World Cup took place in California, with the Rose Bowl hosting eight matches including the final, while Stanford Stadium hosted six matches.\\n\\nBelow is a list of major league sports teams in California:\\n\\n\\n=== Education ===\\n\\nPublic secondary education consists of high schools that teach elective courses in trades, languages, and liberal arts with tracks for gifted, college-bound and industrial arts students. California's public educational system is supported by a unique constitutional amendment that requires a minimum annual funding level for grades K-12 and community colleges that grow with the economy and student enrollment figures.In 2016, California's K-12 public school per-pupil spending was ranked 22nd in the nation ($11,500 / student vs. $11,800 for the US average).For 2012, California's K-12 public schools ranked 48th in the number of employees per student, at 0.102 (the US average was 0.137), while paying the 7th most per employee, $49,000 (the US average was $39,000).A 2007 study concluded that California's public school system was \\\"broken\\\" in that it suffered from over-regulation.California's public postsecondary education offers three separate systems:\\n\\nThe research university system in the state is the University of California (UC), a public university system. As of fall 2011, the University of California had a combined student body of 234,464 students. There are ten general UC campuses, and a number of specialized campuses in the UC system, as the UC San Francisco, which is entirely dedicated to graduate education in health care, and is home to the UCSF Medical Center, the highest ranked hospital in California. The system was originally intended to accept the top one-eighth of California high school students, but several of the schools have become even more selective. The UC system was originally given exclusive authority in awarding Ph.Ds, but this has since changed and the CSU is also able to award several Doctoral degrees.\\nThe California State University (CSU) system has almost 430,000 students. The CSU was originally intended to accept the top one-third of California high school students, but several of the schools have become much more selective. The CSU was originally set up to award only bachelor's and master's degrees, but has since been granted the authority to award several Doctoral degrees.\\nThe California Community Colleges System provides lower division coursework as well as basic skills and workforce training. It is the largest network of higher education in the US, composed of 112 colleges serving a student population of over 2.6 million.California is also home to such notable private universities as Stanford University, the University of Southern California, the California Institute of Technology, and the Claremont Colleges. California has hundreds of other private colleges and universities, including many religious and special-purpose institutions.\\n\\n\\n=== Twin region ===\\nCalifornia has a twinning arrangement with the region of Catalonia in Spain.\\n\\n\\n== Economy ==\\n\\nCalifornia's economy ranks among the largest in the world. As of  2017, the gross state product (GSP) is about $2.75 trillion ($70,000 per capita), the largest in the United States. California is responsible for 13.9 percent of the United States' approximate $18.1 trillion gross domestic product (GDP). As of 2015, California's nominal GDP is larger than all but 4 countries (the United States, China, Japan and Germany). In terms of Purchasing Power Parity, it is larger than all but 10 countries (the United States, China, India, Japan, Germany, Russia, Brazil, France, the United Kingdom, and Indonesia).The five largest sectors of employment in California are trade, transportation, and utilities; government; professional and business services; education and health services; and leisure and hospitality. In output, the five largest sectors are financial services, followed by trade, transportation, and utilities; education and health services; government; and manufacturing.  As of  September 2016, California has an  unemployment rate of 5.5%.\\nCalifornia's economy is dependent on trade and international related commerce accounts for about one-quarter of the state's economy. In 2008, California exported $144 billion worth of goods, up from $134 billion in 2007 and $127 billion in 2006.\\nComputers and electronic products are California's top export, accounting for 42 percent of all the state's exports in 2008.Agriculture is an important sector in California's economy. Farming-related sales more than quadrupled over the past three decades, from $7.3 billion in 1974 to nearly $31 billion in 2004. This increase has occurred despite a 15 percent decline in acreage devoted to farming during the period, and water supply suffering from chronic instability. Factors contributing to the growth in sales-per-acre include more intensive use of active farmlands and technological improvements in crop production. In 2008, California's 81,500 farms and ranches generated $36.2 billion products revenue. In 2011, that number grew to $43.5 billion products revenue. The Agriculture sector accounts for two percent of the state's GDP and employs around three percent of its total workforce. According to the USDA in 2011, the three largest California agricultural products by value were milk and cream, shelled almonds, and grapes.Per capita GDP in 2007 was $38,956, ranking eleventh in the nation. Per capita income varies widely by geographic region and profession. The Central Valley is the most impoverished, with migrant farm workers making less than minimum wage. According to a 2005 report by the Congressional Research Service, the San Joaquin Valley was characterized as one of the most economically depressed regions in the United States, on par with the region of Appalachia. California has a poverty rate of 23.5%, the highest of any state in the country. Many coastal cities include some of the wealthiest per-capita areas in the United States. The high-technology sectors in Northern California, specifically Silicon Valley, in Santa Clara and San Mateo counties, have emerged from the economic downturn caused by the dot-com bust.\\nIn 2010, there were more than 663,000 millionaires in the state, more than any other state in the nation. In 2010, California residents were ranked first among the states with the best average credit score of 754.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n=== State finances ===\\n\\nState spending increased from $56 billion in 1998 to $127 billion in 2011. California, with 12% of the United States population, has one-third of the nation's welfare recipients. California has the third highest per capita spending on welfare among the states, as well as the highest spending on welfare at $6.67 billion. In January 2011 the California's total debt was at least $265 billion. On June 27, 2013, Governor Jerry Brown signed a balanced budget (no deficit) for the state, its first in decades; however the state's debt remains at $132 billion.With the passage of Proposition 30 in 2012, California now levies a 13.3% maximum marginal income tax rate with ten tax brackets, ranging from 1% at the bottom tax bracket of $0 annual individual income to 13.3% for annual individual income over $1,000,000. California has a state sales tax of 7.5%, though local governments can and do levy additional sales taxes. Many of these taxes are temporary for a seven-year period (as stipulated in Proposition 30) and afterwards will revert to a previous maximum marginal income tax bracket of 10.3% and state sales tax rate of 7.25%.All real property is taxable annually; the tax is based on the property's fair market value at the time of purchase or new construction. Property tax increases are capped at 2% annually, per Proposition 13.\\n\\n\\n== Infrastructure ==\\n\\n\\n=== Energy ===\\n\\nBecause it is the most populous state in the United States, California is one of the country's largest users of energy. However because of its high energy rates, conservation mandates, mild weather in the largest population centers and strong environmental movement, its per capita energy use is one of the smallest of any United States state. Due to the high electricity demand, California imports more electricity than any other state, primarily hydroelectric power from states in the Pacific Northwest (via Path 15 and Path 66) and coal- and natural gas-fired production from the desert Southwest via Path 46.As a result of the state's strong environmental movement, California has some of the most aggressive renewable energy goals in the United States, with a target for California to obtain a third of its electricity from renewables by 2020. Currently, several solar power plants such as the Solar Energy Generating Systems facility are located in the Mojave Desert. California's wind farms include Altamont Pass, San Gorgonio Pass, and Tehachapi Pass. Several dams across the state provide hydro-electric power. It would be possible to convert the total supply to 100% renewable energy, including heating, cooling and mobility, by 2050.The state's crude oil and natural gas deposits are located in the Central Valley and along the coast, including the large Midway-Sunset Oil Field. Natural gas-fired power plants typically account for more than one-half of state electricity generation.\\nCalifornia is also home to two major nuclear power plants: Diablo Canyon and San Onofre, the latter having been shut down in 2013. Voters banned the approval of new nuclear power plants since the late 1970s because of concerns over radioactive waste disposal. In addition, several cities such as Oakland, Berkeley and Davis have declared themselves as nuclear-free zones.\\n\\n\\n=== Transportation ===\\n\\nCalifornia's vast terrain is connected by an extensive system of controlled-access highways ('freeways'), limited-access roads ('expressways'), and highways. California is known for its car culture, giving California's cities a reputation for severe traffic congestion. Construction and maintenance of state roads and statewide transportation planning are primarily the responsibility of the California Department of Transportation, nicknamed \\\"Caltrans\\\". The rapidly growing population of the state is straining all of its transportation networks, and California has some of the worst roads in the United States. The Reason Foundation's 19th Annual Report on the Performance of State Highway Systems ranked California's highways the third-worst of any state, with Alaska second, and Rhode Island first.The state has been a pioneer in road construction. One of the state's more visible landmarks, the Golden Gate Bridge, was  the longest suspension bridge main span in the world at 4,200 feet (1,300 m) between 1937 (when it opened) and 1964. With its orange paint and panoramic views of the bay, this highway bridge is a popular tourist attraction and also accommodates pedestrians and bicyclists. The San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge (often abbreviated the \\\"Bay Bridge\\\"), completed in 1936, transports about 280,000 vehicles per day on two-decks. Its two sections meet at Yerba Buena Island through the world's largest diameter transportation bore tunnel, at 76 feet (23 m) wide by 58 feet (18 m) high. The Arroyo Seco Parkway, connecting Los Angeles and Pasadena, opened in 1940 as the first freeway in the Western United States. It was later extended south to the Four Level Interchange in downtown Los Angeles, regarded as the first stack interchange ever built.Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), the 6th busiest airport in the world, and San Francisco International Airport (SFO), the 23rd busiest airport in the world, are major hubs for trans-Pacific and transcontinental traffic. There are about a dozen important commercial airports and many more general aviation airports throughout the state.\\nCalifornia also has several important seaports. The giant seaport complex formed by the Port of Los Angeles and the Port of Long Beach in Southern California is the largest in the country and responsible for handling about a fourth of all container cargo traffic in the United States. The Port of Oakland, fourth largest in the nation, also handles trade entering from the Pacific Rim to the rest of the country. The Port of Stockton is the easternmost port on the west coast of the United States.The California Highway Patrol is the largest statewide police agency in the United States in employment with over 10,000 employees. They are responsible for providing any police-sanctioned service to anyone on California's state-maintained highways and on state property.\\nThe California Department of Motor Vehicles is by far the largest in North America. By the end of 2009, the California DMV had 26,555,006 driver's licenses and ID cards on file. In 2010, there were 1.17 million new vehicle registrations in force.Inter-city rail travel is provided by Amtrak California; the three routes, the Capitol Corridor, Pacific Surfliner, and San Joaquin, are funded by Caltrans. These services are the busiest intercity rail lines in the United States outside the Northeast Corridor and ridership is continuing to set records. The routes are becoming increasingly popular over flying, especially on the LAX-SFO route. Integrated subway and light rail networks are found in Los Angeles (Metro Rail) and San Francisco (MUNI Metro). Light rail systems are also found in San Jose (VTA), San Diego (San Diego Trolley), Sacramento (RT Light Rail), and Northern San Diego County (Sprinter). Furthermore, commuter rail networks serve the San Francisco Bay Area (ACE, BART, Caltrain, SMART), Greater Los Angeles (Metrolink), and San Diego County (Coaster).\\nThe California High-Speed Rail Authority was created in 1996 by the state to implement an extensive 800-mile (1,300 km) rail system. Construction was approved by the voters during the November 2008 general election, with the first phase of construction estimated to cost $64.2 billion.Nearly all counties operate bus lines, and many cities operate their own city bus lines as well. Intercity bus travel is provided by Greyhound, Megabus, and Amtrak Thruway Motorcoach.\\n\\n\\n=== Water ===\\n\\nCalifornia's interconnected water system is the world's largest, managing over 40,000,000 acre feet (49 km3) of water per year, centered on six main systems of aqueducts and infrastructure projects. Water use and conservation in California is a politically divisive issue, as the state experiences periodic droughts and has to balance the demands of its large agricultural and urban sectors, especially in the arid southern portion of the state. The state's widespread redistribution of water also invites the frequent scorn of environmentalists.\\nThe California Water Wars, a conflict between Los Angeles and the Owens Valley over water rights, is one of the most well-known examples of the struggle to secure adequate water supplies. Former California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger said: \\\"We've been in crisis for quite some time because we're now 38 million people and not anymore 18 million people like we were in the late 60s. So it developed into a battle between environmentalists and farmers and between the south and the north and between rural and urban. And everyone has been fighting for the last four decades about water.\\\"\\n\\n\\n== Government and politics ==\\n\\n\\n=== State government ===\\n\\nThe state's capital is Sacramento.\\nCalifornia is organized into three branches of government - the executive branch consisting of the Governor and the other independently elected constitutional officers; the legislative branch consisting of the Assembly and Senate; and the judicial branch consisting of the Supreme Court of California and lower courts. The state also allows ballot propositions: direct participation of the electorate by initiative, referendum, recall, and ratification. Before the passage of California Proposition 14 (2010), California allowed each political party to choose whether to have a closed primary or a primary where only party members and independents vote. After June 8, 2010, when Proposition 14 was approved, excepting only the United States President and county central committee offices, all candidates in the primary elections are listed on the ballot with their preferred party affiliation, but they are not the official nominee of that party. At the primary election, the two candidates with the top votes will advance to the general election regardless of party affiliation. If at a special primary election, one candidate receives more than 50% of all the votes cast, they are elected to fill the vacancy and no special general election will be held.\\nExecutive branchThe California executive branch consists of the Governor of California and seven other elected constitutional officers: Lieutenant Governor, Attorney General, Secretary of State, State Controller, State Treasurer, Insurance Commissioner, and State Superintendent of Public Instruction. They serve four-year terms and may be re-elected only once.\\nLegislative branchThe California State Legislature consists of a 40-member Senate and 80-member Assembly. Senators serve four-year terms and Assembly members two. Members of the Assembly are subject to term limits of three terms, and members of the Senate are subject to term limits of two terms.\\n\\nJudicial branchCalifornia's legal system is explicitly based upon English common law (as is the case with all other states except Louisiana) but carries a few features from Spanish civil law, such as community property. California's prison population grew from 25,000 in 1980 to over 170,000 in 2007. Capital punishment is a legal form of punishment and the state has the largest \\\"Death Row\\\" population in the country (though Oklahoma and Texas are far more active in carrying out executions).California's judiciary system is the largest in the United States (with a total of 1,600 judges, while the federal system has only about 840). At the apex is the seven Justices of the Supreme Court of California, while the California Courts of Appeal serve as the primary appellate courts and the California Superior Courts serve as the primary trial courts. Justices of the Supreme Court and Courts of Appeal are appointed by the Governor, but are subject to retention by the electorate every 12 years. The administration of the state's court system is controlled by the Judicial Council, composed of the Chief Justice of the California Supreme Court, 14 judicial officers, four representatives from the State Bar of California, and one member from each house of the state legislature.\\n\\n\\n==== Local government ====\\n\\n\\n===== Counties =====\\n\\nCalifornia is divided into 58 counties. Per Article 11, Section 1, of the Constitution of California, they are the legal subdivisions of the state. The county government provides countywide services such as law enforcement, jails, elections and voter registration, vital records, property assessment and records, tax collection, public health, health care, social services, libraries, flood control, fire protection, animal control, agricultural regulations, building inspections, ambulance services, and education departments in charge of maintaining statewide standards. In addition, the county serves as the local government for all unincorporated areas. Each county is governed by an elected board of supervisors.\\n\\n\\n===== City and town governments =====\\nIncorporated cities and towns in California are either charter or general-law municipalities. General-law municipalities owe their existence to state law and are consequently governed by it; charter municipalities are governed by their own city or town charters. Municipalities incorporated in the 19th century tend to be charter municipalities. All ten of the state's most populous cities are charter cities. Most small cities have a council-manager form of government, where the elected city council appoints a city manager to supervise the operations of the city. Some larger cities have a directly-elected mayor who oversees the city government. In many council-manager cities, the city council selects one of its members as a mayor, sometimes rotating through the council membership--but this type of mayoral position is primarily ceremonial.\\nThe Government of San Francisco is the only consolidated city-county in California, where both the city and county governments have been merged into one unified jurisdiction. The San Francisco Board of Supervisors also acts as the city council and the Mayor of San Francisco also serves as the county administrative officer.\\n\\n\\n===== School districts and special districts =====\\n\\nAbout 1,102 school districts, independent of cities and counties, handle California's public education. California school districts may be organized as elementary districts, high school districts, unified school districts combining elementary and high school grades, or community college districts.There are about 3,400 special districts in California. A special district, defined by California Government Code SS 16271(d) as \\\"any agency of the state for the local performance of governmental or proprietary functions within limited boundaries\\\", provides a limited range of services within a defined geographic area. The geographic area of a special district can spread across multiple cities or counties, or could consist of only a portion of one. Most of California's special districts are single-purpose districts, and provide one service.\\n\\n\\n=== Federal representation ===\\n\\nThe state of California sends 53 members to the House of Representatives, the nation's largest congressional state delegation. Consequently California also has the largest number of electoral votes in national presidential elections, with 55. California's U.S. Senators are Dianne Feinstein, a native and former mayor of San Francisco, and Kamala Harris, a native, former District Attorney from San Francisco and former Attorney General of California. In 1992, California became the first state to have a Senate delegation entirely composed of women.\\n\\n\\n=== Armed forces ===\\nIn California, as of  2009, the U.S. Department of Defense had a total of 117,806 active duty servicemembers of which 88,370 were Sailors or Marines, 18,339 were Airmen, and 11,097 were Soldiers, with 61,365 Department of Defense civilian employees. Additionally, there were a total of 57,792 Reservists and Guardsman in California.In 2010, Los Angeles County was the largest origin of military recruits in the United States by county, with 1,437 individuals enlisting in the military. However, as of 2002, Californians were relatively under-represented in the military as a proportion to its population.In 2000, California, had 2,569,340 veterans of United States military service: 504,010 served in World War II, 301,034 in the Korean War, 754,682 during the Vietnam War, and 278,003 during 1990-2000 (including the Persian Gulf War). As of  2010, there were 1,942,775 veterans living in California, of which 1,457,875 served during a period of armed conflict, and just over four thousand served before World War II (the largest population of this group of any state).California's military forces consist of the Army and Air National Guard, the naval and state military reserve (militia), and the California Cadet Corps.\\n\\n\\n=== Ideology ===\\n\\nCalifornia has an idiosyncratic political culture compared to the rest of the country, and is sometimes regarded as a trendsetter. In socio-cultural mores and national politics, Californians are perceived as more liberal than other Americans, especially those who live in the inland states.  As  of the 2016 presidential election, California was the 2nd most democratic state behind Hawaii.  According to the Cook Political Report, California contains 5 of the 15 most democratic congressional districts in the United States.Among the political idiosyncrasies and trendsetting, California was the second state to recall their state governor, the second state to legalize abortion, and the only state to ban marriage for gay couples twice by voters (including Proposition 8 in 2008). Voters also passed Proposition 71 in 2004 to fund stem cell research, and Proposition 14 in 2010 to completely change the state's primary election process. California has also experienced disputes over water rights; and a tax revolt, culminating with the passage of Proposition 13 in 1978, limiting state property taxes.\\nThe state's trend towards the Democratic Party and away from the Republican Party can be seen in state elections. From 1899 to 1939, California had Republican governors. Since 1990, California has generally elected Democratic candidates to federal, state and local offices, including current Governor Jerry Brown; however, the state has elected Republican Governors, though many of its Republican Governors, such as Arnold Schwarzenegger, tend to be considered moderate Republicans and more centrist than the national party.\\nThe Democrats also now hold a majority in both houses of the state legislature. There are 56 Democrats and 24 Republicans in the Assembly; and 26 Democrats and 12 Republicans in the Senate.\\nThe trend towards the Democratic Party is most obvious in presidential elections. From 1960 to 1988, California was a Republican stronghold, with the party carrying the state's electoral votes in every election except for 1964. California Republicans Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan were elected as the 37th and the 40th U.S. Presidents, respectively. However, Democrats have won all of California's electoral votes since 1992.\\nIn the United States House, the Democrats held a 34-19 edge in the CA delegation of the 110th United States Congress in 2007. As the result of gerrymandering, the districts in California were usually dominated by one or the other party, and few districts were considered competitive. In 2008, Californians passed Proposition 20 to empower a 14-member independent citizen commission to redraw districts for both local politicians and Congress. After the 2012 elections, when the new system took effect, Democrats gained 4 seats and held a 38-15 majority in the delegation.\\n\\nIn general, Democratic strength is centered in the populous coastal regions of the Los Angeles metropolitan area and the San Francisco Bay Area. Republican strength is still greatest in eastern parts of the state. Orange County also remains mostly Republican. One study ranked Berkeley, Oakland, Inglewood and San Francisco in the top 20 most liberal American cities; and Bakersfield, Orange, Escondido, Garden Grove, and Simi Valley in the top 20 most conservative cities.In October 2012, out of the 23,802,577 people eligible to vote, 18,245,970 people were registered to vote. Of the people registered, the three largest registered groups were Democrats (7,966,422), Republicans (5,356,608), and Decline to State (3,820,545). Los Angeles County had the largest number of registered Democrats (2,430,612) and Republicans (1,037,031) of any county in the state.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nIndex of California-related articles\\nOutline of California - organized list of topics about California\\n\\n\\n== Notes ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n=== Works cited ===\\nCohen, Saul Bernard (2003).

The label has been featured in The New York Times, New Yorker, The Observer, a Sundance Channel production, features on NPR,  and a 2004 documentary, You See Me Laughin. Fat Possum also distributes the Hi Records catalog.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nFat Possum was founded in 1991 by  Living Blues editor  Peter Redvers-Lee, who went to the University of Mississippi for his MA studies in Journalism. He planned on starting a record label and picked the name with another student, Billy 'pup' Cochrane. Johnson, who grew up in the state was a student at the University of Mississippi. By 1994 or so  Lee left, and freelance recording engineer Bruce Watson assumed his managerial role. An early investor was John Hermann of Widespread Panic, who also pitched Robert Palmer's name as producer.The label initially specialised in discovering blues players from the North Mississippi region, many of whom had never recorded before. At Fat Possum's behest some artists, particularly R. L. Burnside, released both standard blues albums and more techno albums, done in the style that would later be made famous by Moby's album Play. This led to a fair amount of controversy among blues purists, a group in which Johnson was largely uninterested. Many of the early artists for Fat Possum were picked with the aid of Palmer (previously a teacher of Johnson at the University of Mississippi), who also produced a number of records for the label.\\nAlthough their releases were critically acclaimed, particularly Junior Kimbrough's album All Night Long, which received 4 stars from Rolling Stone and the loud approval of Iggy Pop, In 1995 they added Arkansas bluesman John \\\"So Blue\\\" Weston to their roster, with \\\"So Doggone Blue\\\" (FP 1003) produced by Living Blues writer Larry Hoffman. Disputes between the artist and label resulted in Hoffman buying back the master and selling it to Evidence Records (UPC: 730182609226)  Fat Possum was perennially strapped for cash. Word of mouth and artist compilations, such as Not the Same Old Blues Crap 3 (with a cover illustration by Joe Sacco) and All Men Are Liars, gradually pulled Fat Possum out of the red, even if only for brief periods of time. A legal fight with Capricorn Records, who were to be their distributor, drained Fat Possum's funds and left a number of projects on the shelf.Burnside proved early on to be the label's biggest money maker. Having released two albums, he teamed with The Jon Spencer Blues Explosion for a tour, and then recorded with the band A Ass Pocket of Whiskey, which helped Burnside and Fat Possum gain wider recognition. A remix of the R. L. Burnside song, \\\"It's Bad You Know\\\", was also featured prominently on The Sopranos.\\nWith time, many of the label's artists have died. Asie Payton, King Ernest, and Charles Caldwell died before their records could be released. Kimbrough died in 1998 and Burnside 2005. T-Model Ford and Robert Belfour joined in the 2010s.\\nResponding to the first deaths, Fat Possum begun to release more archival records. George Mitchell's recordings came out first as individual albums of Furry Lewis, Mississippi Joe Callicott, R.L. Burnside, Townes Van Zandt, and others, with covers designed by Chip Kidd, and then in bulk as the George Mitchell Collection. They acquired the Al Green catalog including his 1975 Greatest Hits.The successful band The Black Keys released their second album Thickfreakness (2003) on Fat Possum, and left the label after their third album Rubber Factory (2004). Solomon Burke's \\\"comeback\\\" album, Don't Give Up On Me, won the 2003 Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Blues Album. In 2013, Fat Possum released \\\"Ready To Die\\\" by Iggy and the Stooges.\\nConcluding that further searches for rural talent are hopeless, it has begun to broaden its base of artists and sign a range of younger, indie rock bands like Andrew Bird, Milk Music, MellowHype, the Heartless Bastards, Deadboy & the Elephantmen, Wavves, Youth Lagoon, The Walkmen, Temples (band), Yuck (band), Fat White Family, The Districts, Crocodiles, Bass Drum of Death, and Soccer Mommy. They have tapped into the indie-folk scene releasing Verbena's frontman A.A. Bondy's solo records, The Felice Brothers, and female songwriter Lissie.\\nIn 2017 Fat Possum partnered with founding Gorilla vs. Bear blogger Chris Cantalini to start new label Luminelle Recordings. Canadian singer-songwriter Helena Deland was the label's first signing.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nList of record labels\\nPunk blues\\nCategory:Fat Possum Records artists\\n\\n\\n== Notes and references ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nOfficial website\", \"rev_id\": 848594377, \"accessed\": \"2018-09-03 00:23:59.864295\", \"links\": [\"Townes Van Zandt\", \"King Ernest\", \"A.A.

Fatboy Slim, then of Beats International, the label lifted its moniker and aesthetic from the Japanese TV shows of the 1950s and 1960s based on the Ninja. With their first releases in the early 1990s, Ninja Tune went on to, according to Pitchfork, \\\"usher in trip-hop/instrumental hip hop\\\".After Coldcut's success with their first label, their titled Ahead of Our Time, contractual issues prevented them to release anything under their own name. Ninja Tune's inaugural release was Coldcut's (under the name Bogus Order) house break collection Zen Brakes Vol. 1 in 1990. The label got a bigger name for itself when Coldcut, as DJ Food, released their funky hip hop jazz-breaks album, Jazz Brakes Vol. 1, which, according to Record Collector, \\\"blew up\\\" in the DJ circuit. DJ Food's Jazz Brakes series were intended as musical \\\"food\\\" or, in other words, source material for DJs and producers who worked with breaks and beats.\\nIn 1992, Peter Quicke stepped aboard as label manager, as did Patrick Carpenter, a.k.a. PC, who joined Coldcut as sound engineer. PC would become a crucial member of Ninja Tune, and from Jazz Brakes Vol. 4 onwards, an integral part of the DJ Food production team.\\nSteinski, a big inspiration behind Coldcut's initial forays into music, released his first Ninja Tune EP as Steinski and Mass Media in the same year. The single, in the words of Pitchfork, \\\"builds on a catchy loop of the Jackson 5's 'It's Great to Be Here' and creates one of the few anti-Gulf War protest songs of the era, transforming [ U.S. President George H. W. ] Bush's speech into a pop hook ('Regrettably, we now believe/ That only force will make him leave') and interspersing quotes from Jello Biafra ('don't hate the media, become the media!') and Mario Savio's famous 1964 address to the Berkeley Free Speech Movement\\\".Between 1994 and 1997 Ninja explored and defined the instrumental hip hop beats sound further (often known as trip hop). Its pioneering influence on the genre became more prevalent with the label's first compilation, Funkjazztical Tricknology, in 1995. The genre originated in England as a successor to acid house, taking in acid jazz and funk, and using hip hop style breakbeats rather than the mechanical '4 on the floor' drum rhythm of house. Ninja artists especially looked beyond the normal sampling sources of old funk records into jazz, epitomised by Ninja act The Cinematic Orchestra.\\nColdcut's contribution to Britain's flourishing scene was solidified by their Solid Steel show on London's Kiss FM, on airwaves since 1988. The ongoing success of Solid Steel, and its subsequent syndication across the globe, broadcast the Ninja brand across the airwaves. The late night Saturday show cut all manner of beats, samples and loops into a chaotic musical blend. The show's 'everything but the kitchen sink' approach continued through Coldcut's \\\"utterly brilliant\\\" Journeys by DJ series of mix compilations in 1995. The title 70 Minutes of Madness was a nod to Coldcut's earlier Eric B & Rakim remix, and included sounds from Depth Charge, DJ Food, Plastikman, Mantronix, Harold Budd and the Doctor Who theme.\\nIn 1994, Matt Black's close friend Mixmaster Morris introduced Matt to Openmind - a DJ & design collective in Camberwell - at the Telepathic Fish chill-out club they were running. Openmind included Kevin Foakes a.k.a. Strictly Kev of DJ Food. After submitting a re-styled company logo he was employed by Ninja Tune in the capacity of overall design consultant. Matt Black also invited Foakes to Ninja's recording studio, where he eventually joined the many hands at work on DJ Food's 1995 album, Recipe for Disaster (which also included Patrick Carpenter a.k.a. PC, Isaac Elliston, Paul Rabiger and Paul Brooks). The album was called a \\\"whirlwind of beats put through the blender\\\" and proved a good cross-selection of the group's various styles.In 1995, The Herbaliser, one of the more purely hip-hop oriented acts on Ninja Tune's roster at that point  released their debut album Remedies. Remedies brought both the group and the label much attention..\\nAlso in 1995, an album launch party for DJ Food's Recipe for Disaster was the beginning what would become a regular club night, Stealth. Stealth was named Club of the Year by NME in 1996, with guests including Kruder & Dorfmeister, Squarepusher, Ashley Beedle, James Lavelle, Kid Koala and the label roster. Around the same time, Ninja Tune began organizing its first package tours across the UK and Europe.\\nWith their two 1994 albums, Paradise Blown and Electric Lazyland, 9 Lazy 9 helped spawn the funky, subterranean sound for which Ninja Tune would earn its early acclaim, combining hip hop and funk breakbeats with jazz-influenced sound. Their success inspired one half of the Italian-based duo, James Braddell, to return to the UK and begin his own solo project. As Funki Porcini, Braddell released Hed Phone Sex in 1995, which ran through a gamut of genres, from dub to drum and bass. Braddell continued to explore sonic territories on 1996's Let's See What Carmen Can Do EP and the Love, Pussycats and Car Wrecks album from the same year.\\nDJ Vadim, a Russian born turntablist from London, who'd already released EPs on his own Jazz Fudge label, further expanded the vocabulary of instrumental hip hop with his 1996 album U.S.S.R. Repertoire, bringing \\\"locked grooves and ultra-vivid, up-close sample-textures\\\". U.S.S.R. Reconstruction followed in 1998, a remix album filled with hip hop that The Wire claimed \\\"turns the air into molasses\\\". With U.S.S.R. Reconstruction, Vadim selected a baker's dozen of likeminded producers, including Reflection, Clatterbox. DJ Krush, Silent Poets and Kid Koala, creating an album that flows without a hitch through the darkest hip hop and beat exploration.Throughout the 1990s, Matt Black began exploring his own interests in burgeoning computer and audio/visual technologies, to experiment with the VJ software and hardware that was already changing the Coldcut DJ performances. His Hex collective - also featuring artist Robert Pepperell and programmer Miles Visman - produced video games and multimedia CD-Roms in the early 1990s, along with subsequent projects that further affirmed Ninja Tune's alliance with A/V disciples. Teaming up with Hexstatic member Stuart Warren-Hill (who also signed to the Ntone label for several audio visual albums), Coldcut's \\\"Timber\\\" video - an AV collage piece using analogous techniques to audio sample collage - was put on heavy rotation on MTV, and won awards for its innovative use of repetitive video clips synced to the music, including being shortlisted at the Edinburgh Television and Film Festival in their top five music videos of the year in 1998.In 1995, Matt Black created Pipe, Ninja's first website. The label's current website ninjatune.net was developed by the following year.\\nAlso in 1996, Ninja Tune expanded across the ocean, opening its Montreal office to manage distribution across North America. That same year, Ninja Tune cemented its place with the double-disc Flexistentialism, a rare compilation that featured the label's growing roster, including DJ Food, Funki Porcini, The Herbaliser, Luke Vibert, Kruder & Dorfmeister and DJ Vadim, among others. With Flexistentialism, Ninja was described as devising \\\"a term that perfectly expresses the antitheses between chaos and order\\\"Amon Tobin, meanwhile, was building groundbreaking drum and bass from 1950s big band drum battles. His 1997 Ninja Tune debut, Bricolage, contains influences from drum and bass, hip hop, blues, jazz and samba, all digitally processed to create a sense of the bricolage suggested by the title. The album proved a strong seller, especially in America, where Pitchfork awarded the album a perfect 10.0. The following year's immensely complex album, Permutation, saw Tobin creating electronic experimentation that retools d'n'b's basic structures to a practically surreal extent.In 1997 Stealth finished at the Blue Note (in Hoxton), and Ninja Tune's sister label Big Dada was launched. Coldcut's fourth album Let Us Play! was released in September 1997, making its way to the Top 40, reaching No. 33 in the UK Charts. Let Us Play! paid homage to the greats that inspired them. Their first album to be released on Ninja Tune, it featured guest appearances by Grandmaster Flash, Steinski, Jello Biafra, Jimpster, The Herbaliser, Talvin Singh, Daniel Pemberton and Selena Saliva. Coldcut's cut 'n' paste method on the album was compared to that of Dadaism and William S. Burroughs. Hex collaborated with Coldcut to produce the multimedia CD-Rom for the album. Hex later evolved the software into the engine that was used on the Let Us Play! world tour.\\nIn 1999, Let Us Replay! was released, a double-disc remix album where Coldcut's classic tunes were remixed by Cornelius (the opener of the album, which was heralded as a highlight of the album), Irresistible Force, Shut Up and Dance, Carl Craig and J Swinscoe. Spin Magazine stated that Let Us Replay! pieces together \\\"short sharp shocks that put the mental in 'experimental' and still bring the breaks till the breakadawn\\\". It also includes a few live tracks from the duo's innovative world tour. The CD-Rom of the album, which also contained a free demo disc of the VJamm software, was one of the earliest audiovisual CD- Roms on the market, and Muzik claimed deserved to \\\"have them canonized...it's like buying an entire mini studio for under $15\\\".In March 1999, Big Dada introduced Rodney Smith, a.k.a. Roots Manuva. Brand New Second Hand was, in the words of AllMusic, \\\"a bright moment for British rap, the debut album from Roots Manuva introduced a hip hop chameleon boasting dark productions and a distinct style, plus much more to say than most rappers\\\". He soon became heralded for his unique delivery, which Pitchfork claimed one of the \\\"addictive, compelling, and, above all, heartfelt\\\".Having worked as an intern in the Ninja Tune office in the mid 1990s, Jason Swinscoe became an instrumental part of the team, and by 1998 he released his first 12\\\" as The Cinematic Orchestra, Diabolus, shortly followed by the full length Motion. The surprise hit album landed somewhere between jazz and electronica and gathered samples from unlikely sources. That same year, Swinscoe began performing live with an expanded line-up, featuring Federico Ughi on drums, Alex James on piano and DJ Food's Patrick Carpenter on turntables.\\nMr. Scruff's Keep It Unreal was released in the summer of 1999. Filled with bubbly breakbeats, slick horn sizzles and bristling house beats, the album opened with BBC Radio 1 DJ Mary Ann Hobbes asking, \\\"Are you ready Mr. Scruff?\\\"\\nAt some point in 1999, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission decided that DJ Vadim and Sarah Jones' pro-women empowerment record Your Revolution was \\\"indecent\\\" for radio. The decision ended up in court in 2002, where arguments were advanced for freedom of speech, freedom of expression and to argue the double standards of the ban and fine.\\n\\n\\n=== 2000-10 ===\\nIn 2000, Ninja Tune celebrated its first decade of music with Xen Cuts, a three CD, 6 x LP box set that provided a collection of their artists. The mostly downtempo affair featured the likes of Latyrx (Lyrics Born and Lateef), The Herbaliser, Kid Koala and Luke Vibert, Clifford Gilberto, Amon Tobin and Funki Porcini.\\nAlso in 2000, Kid Koala released Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, \\\"a playfully arranged montage of quirky sound bites, rhythmic scratching and fluid hip hop beats\\\". Relying as heavily upon comedy albums and sound effects records as jazz and funk vinyl for sample material, the release, which was called brilliant and humorous received much critical success. Kid Koala cut two further highly acclaimed albums for Ninja, 2003's Some of My Best Friends Are DJs and 2006's Your Mom's Favorite DJ.\\nIn 2001, Roots Manuva delivered his second album, Run Come Save Me, which was deemed one of the albums of the year by The Independent, and \\\"not just a landmark UK hip hop album, but a landmark hip hop album period\\\" by Mojo. The album charted at number 33 in the UK Charts. \\\"Witness (1 Hope)\\\", the first single off the album, charted at #45, and was declared by AllMusic as being \\\"the best British rap single since Tricky's 'Aftermath'\\\". Run Come Save Me won a nomination for the 2002 Mercury Music Award, and was called by The Times \\\"Too maverick, too brilliantly original a talent to be tethered by mere genre or geography.\\\"missing ref\\nAlso in 2001 Cornwall's Luke Vibert joined Ninja Tune. Growing up amongst contemporaries Aphex Twin and Tom Middleton/Global Communication, Vibert had made a name for himself in experimental electronica, though his name has always been hard to pin down: he operates under several different aliases. With the moniker Wagon Christ, Vibert released Musipal on Ninja, which NME called \\\"an intriguing procession of cheeky collages\\\".Mr. Scruff's second album on Ninja Tune, Trouser Jazz, was released on 9 September 2002. It charted at 29 on the UK Chart.\\nIn 2003, Simon Green, a.k.a. Bonobo, released his first proper Ninja album, Dial 'M' for Monkey, a subliminally seductive collection of atmospheric instrumentals. A live version of Bonobo soon took to the road, which seeped into the production of 2006's Days to Come, an album that blurs the line between a programmed and live sound and created \\\"a daydream vibe embedded within its moodiness\\\".Blurring lines further, Coldcut collaborated with American video mashup artist TV Sheriff in 2004 to produce their cut-up entitled Revolution USA. The tactical-media project (coordinated with Canadian art duo NomIg) followed on from the UK version and extended the premise \\\"into an open access participatory project\\\". Through the multimedia political art project, over 12 gigabytes of footage from the last 40 years of US politics were made accessible to download, allowing participants to create a cut-up over a Coldcut beat. Coldcut also collaborated with TV Sheriff and NomIg to produce two audiovisual pieces \\\"World of Evil\\\" (2004) and \\\"Revolution '08\\\" (2008), both composed of footage from the United States presidential elections of respective years. The music used was composed by Coldcut, with \\\"Revolution '08\\\" featuring a remix by The Qemists.\\nRoots Manuva climbed back into the limelight at the beginning of 2005, with his deft  album Awfully Deep. His third album, which reached number 24 in the UK Charts, was celebrated by critics for his growth as an artist, with NME calling it \\\"a set of immense maturity that never rubs your nose in its thematic complexity, compositional innovation and thunderous thump-beats\\\".The Cinematic Orchestra scored a new soundtrack, Man with a Movie Camera (The Cinematic Orchestra album), for a screening of the visionary 1929 Russian silent feature, Man with a Movie Camera, for the 2000 Portuguese Film Festival Fantasporto. The following year it was performed at the opening gala of Portugal's year as European Capital of Culture in Porto in front of 3000 people. The material written for this film score laid the groundwork for what would be The Cinematic Orchestra's second full-length, Every Day, released in May 2002, and one of Ninja's best-selling albums. Roots Manuva featured on the track \\\"All Things to All Men\\\", which later soundtracked the final scenes of 2006 movie Kidulthood. The Cinematic Orchestra's albums grew increasingly ambitious over the years, with 2007's Ma Fleur album marking a move away from beats, and embracing folk influences. The album was based on the work of photographer Maya Hayuk (who commissioned 11 pictures based on three short stories recounting the journey from birth to death), and conceived by Swinscoe as the premise for the score of an imaginary film. Album track \\\"To Build a Home\\\" became one of Ninja's top tracks of all time (with its fan video clocking up nearly 9 million plays), and track \\\"TBAH\\\" features vocals from Patrick Watson, which became the band's most successful song.\\nFollowing Jason Swinscoe's vocal appreciation of Jaga Jazzist's 2001 album A Livingroom Hush, the Norwegian jazz band signed to Ninja Tune to re-release A Livingroom Hush in 2002, followed by The Stix later that year, and their fourth album What We Must in 2005.\\nColdcut returned with the single \\\"Everything Is Under Control\\\" at the end of 2005, featuring Jon Spencer (of Jon Spencer Blues Explosion) and Mike Ladd. It was followed in 2006 by their fifth studio album Sound Mirrors, which was quoted as being \\\"one of the most vital and imaginative records Jon More and Matt Black have ever made\\\", and saw the duo \\\"continue, impressively, to find new ways to present political statements through a gamut of pristine electronics and breakbeats\\\". The fascinating array of guest vocalists included Soweto Kinch, Annette Peacock, Amiri Baraka, and Saul Williams.\\nNinja hooked up with L.A. filmmaker and photographer B+, who had filmed Keepintime: Talking Drums Whispering Vinyl, a short movie documenting a meeting between jazz/funk drummers Paul Humphrey and James Gadson, and a bunch of turntablists who now scratched and sampled their breakbeats, including DJ Shadow, Cut Chemist and the Beat Junkies. This project snowballed into a live concert featuring the drum duo jamming along with the turntablists - and included extra guests Madlib and DJ Numark. In 2005, Ninja released Keep in Time: A Live Recording, a CD/DVD package that included remixes from King Britt, Oh No, J Rocc and AmmonContact.\\nBack in London, having previously scored a place with his college band E.V.A. on the 1996 Ninja 12\\\" One Track Mind, Fin Greenall subsequently signed to the label as a solo artist, under the name Fink. First releasing Fresh Produce - an atmospheric set of downtempo instrumental hip hop tracks - on sister label Ntone in 2000, it was 2006's Biscuits for Breakfast album that set Fink officially on Ninja Tune. And it set him far apart from the rest of the label, going his own way to become a full-blown, guitar picking singer-songwriter. Two subsequent full lengths - 2007's Distance and Time and 2009's Sort of Revolution (which featured song-writing collaborations with John Legend) have seen Fink further develop this new sound.\\nOn the topic of sound, noise manipulator Amon Tobin came back around at the beginning of 2007 with Foley Room, his sixth studio album, and a long player that was called his \\\"darkest work yet\\\". Tobin was inspired by the work of foley artists: a foley room is where the sound effects are recorded for films; foley artists use their imagination and ingenuity to make the right noise for the situation they are presented with. Amon and a team of assistants headed out into the streets with high sensitivity microphones and recorded found sounds from tigers roaring to cats eating rats, from wasps to falling chickpeas, kitchen utensils to motorbikes to water dripping from a tap. Added to this were the sounds of The Kronos Quartet, Stefan Schneider (of To Rococo Rot) and Sarah Page, Tobin travelling from foley rooms in Montreal to San Francisco to Seattle and back as he collected them (the CD release is accompanied by a short DVD, Foley Room: Found Footage, documenting the recording process).\\nKevin Martin began developing his own sound further as The Bug, after other projects as GOD, Techno Animal, Ice and Curse of the Golden Vampire. The Bug's second album in 2003, Pressure, demonstrated a fully formed aesthetic - stark spaces, gleefully subsonic bass  - holding collaborations with vocalists such as Toastie Taylor, Wayne Lonesome and Daddy Freddy. 2008's London Zoo, meanwhile, was The Bug's third album - and first for Ninja Tune. Recorded over three years with its maker living in his studio, without a kitchen or shower, the album included collaborations with Warrior Queen, Tippa Irie, Burial, Kode9 collaborator Spaceape, and even singer-toaster Ricky Ranking showing up on three tracks. The multivocal, spoken-sung, collaborative album has enjoyed recent cult success, appearing in many outlets' Best of 2008 lists.\\nThe year 2008 launched Ninja Tune's You Don't Know, their sixth official label sampler, and, like its predecessors, contained high quality picks from their major releases, with select remixes and a few rarities. While 2007's Well Deep multimedia package shed light on Big Dada, Ninja Cuts drew a healthy cross-section from all three Ninja associated labels.2008 also marked Daedelus' first official Ninja album, Love to Make Music To, after his previous albums Exquisite Corpse and Denies the Day's Demise had been licensed by Ninja Tune. The album showcased the L.A. artist's diverse nature and his skills as a multi-instrumentalist as well as his engrossing stylistic shifts. Additionally that year (a year after their 2007 Stompbox 12\\\"), The Qemists released their debut album, Join the Q. Known to construct some of the most energetic breakbeats of the late 2000s, the vinyl version of the album comes as four super-heavy platters, weighing nearly a kilogram.\\nIn 2008, an international group of party organisers, activists and artists - including Coldcut - received a grant from the Intelligent Energy Department of the European Union, to create a project that promoted intelligent energy and environmental awareness to the youth of Europe. The result was Energy Union, a piece of VJ cinema, political campaign, music tour, party, art exhibition and social media hub. Energy Union toured 12 EU countries throughout 2009 and 2010, completing 24 events in total. Coldcut created the Energy Union show for the tour, a one-hour Audio/Visual montage on the theme of Intelligent Energy. In presenting new ideas for climate, environmental and energy communication strategies, the Energy Union tour was well received, and reached a widespread audience in cities across the UK, Germany, Belgium, The Netherlands, Croatia, Slovenia, Austria, Hungary, Bulgaria, Spain and the Czech Republic.missing reference\\nSpeech Debelle's debut album, 2009's Speech Therapy, finally scored Big Dada a Mercury Prize, after prior nominations for Roots Manuva's Run Come Save Me and Ty's Upwards. With the album, NME called her: \\\"one to seriously watch\\\".\\n\\n\\n=== 2010-present ===\\nIn 2010, Ninja Tune celebrated 20 years of releasing music. A book entitled Ninja Tune: 20 Years of Beats and Pieces was released on 12 August 2010, and an exhibition was held at Black Dog Publishing's Black Dog Space in London showcasing artwork, design and photography from the label's 20-year history. A \\\"stunning futurespective\\\" compilation album was released on 20 September in two formats - a regular version consisting of two 2-disc volumes, and a limited edition (of 3,500 copies), containing six CDs, six 7\\\" vinyl singles, a hardback copy of the book, a poster and additional items. It featured new music from Amon Tobin (also as Two Fingers), Roots Manuva, The Cinematic Orchestra, Kid Koala, Mr Scruff, The Bug, King Geedorah, Zomby, Bonobo, Toddla T, Daedelus, Dorian Concept, Floating Points, Wagon Christ, cLOUDDEAD and many others. It also included new remixes from Switch, Autechre, Benga, Cut Chemist, Modeselektor, Roots Manuva, Diplo, Gold Panda, Mark Pritchard, Rustie, Prefuse 73, 808 State, Joe Goddard, King Jammy, The Orb, Micachu, Gaslamp Killer, Kronos Quartet, Mala, El-P (and El-B) and many more. In The Independent's \\\"Album of the Week\\\" review, the compilation was deemed \\\"a glorious celebration of Ninja Tune's audio splendour\\\".As part of the 20th anniversary, Ninja Tune produced 20 different events around the world. Ninja Tune sold out Royal Albert Hall in London, with The Cinematic Orchestra, Amon Tobin and Dorian Concept all presenting a one-off orchestral performance with the London Metropolitan Orchestra arranged by composer Ilan Eshkeri. For a separate London event, Ninja also placed a legendary rave in 3 rooms in a car park behind the Tate Modern with all of their artists in one place for first time (artists included Coldcut, Mr Scruff, Roots Manuva, Toddla T, The Bug, Daedelus, Kid Koala, Bonobo, Dj Food + DK, Mark Pritchard, DJ Kentaro, Dorian Concept, XXXchange (Spank Rock), DELS, Floating Points, Jammer, Dark Sky and Offshore). For the Ninja XX gig in New York, the label's venue (Santos Party House) was shut down unexpectedly, moving the event at the last minute to the Bowery (CITATION: Brooklyn Vegan, 28 October 2010).In October 2011, Ninja Tune's massive \\\"Ninja Tune XX\\\" campaign won \\\"Innovative Marketing Campaign of the Year\\\" at the 2011 AIM Awards.It was around this time that Ninja Tune began expanding its roster in an interesting new direction, co-signing underground labels with whom they felt artistically aligned. In February 2010, LA-based producer Flying Lotus, a.k.a. Steven Ellison, announced his Brainfeeder imprint had struck up a partnership for Ninja Tune to handle manufacturing, marketing and distribution for Brainfeeder everywhere outside the US. In April 2010, Sheffield-born producer and DJ Toddla T (who'd originally arrived at Ninja having produced parts of Roots Manuva's 2008 album, Slime & Reason, which reached number 22 in the UK Charts) also signed his Girls Music record label to Ninja Tune for distribution, manufacturing and marketing, in addition to signing a three-album deal. In June 2012, Ninja announced a partnership with underground artist Actress and his Werkdiscs imprint, home to Zomby's Where Were U in 92?, Actress's Hazyville, and various records by Lukid and Lone.Also in 2010, Bonobo's own Black Sands album marked his fourth full-length. It pushed Bonobo's sound \\\"much more steeped in beat-making, creating deluxe, post-dance soundscapes\\\", and achieved worldwide commercial success. In February 2012, Ninja followed up with a remix album, Black Sands Remixed, which featured re-imaginings from producers such as Lapalux, Mark Pritchard, Machinedrum and FaltyDL.\\nA couple months before, in November 2011, New York producer FaltyDL had made his debut on the Ninja roster with his Atlantis EP, a \\\"smoother and shufflier\\\" ride than most of his earlier work. His work for Ninja was deemed \\\"calm and focused, a trend that continued on his third album\\\", Hardcourage, released in January 2012. The album was \\\"sure-footed and big-hearted, accessible and yet cerebral\\\".Jaga Jazzist returned in 2010 with their strongest release to date, One-Armed Bandit, which featured new members within Jaga Jazzist's ranks and included \\\"tropical polyrhythms, modernist patterns, and even techno-inspired synth sequences\\\".Another release that pushed Ninja to new sonic territories came from London-based artist Floating Points at the end of 2010 with 'Post Suite / Almost In Profile'. The Floating Points Ensemble is an instrumental ensemble headed by himself on Fender Rhodes and Sequential Circuits Pro One and Prophet keyboards. The double A-side 10\\\" vinyl single featured two tracks by the full Ensemble, recorded and mixed at Abbey Road Studios for the Ninja Tune XX twentieth anniversary celebration.\\nIn 2010, a sound designer  from Berlin (by way of Bristol), Emika, brought a new sound to the label, with her melodic, R&B tinged bass-heavy 'Double Edge.' Her self-titled debut was later released in 2011, bridging the \\\"minimalist menace of Bristol dubstep to breathy accessible vocals and classical piano\\\". On her 2013 follow-up, 'DVA,' Emika beefed up her songwriting, focusing on political and personal themes.In March 2011, another exploratory bass cadet - Dorian Concept - released his first Ninja EP, Her Tears Taste Like Pears. It proved to be a \\\"solid example of the kind of genius Concept, himself something of a child piano prodigy, is capable of\\\".The following May saw the release of a much-awaited album from Amon Tobin, ISAM, which set a new benchmark for live electronic music. Tobin decided to step away from previous DJ centric performances, and instead provided a large-scale live audio/visual experience to select cities around the world. Developed alongside V Squared Labs, Leviathan, Vello Virkhaus & Matt Daly, Alex Lazarus, Vitamotus Design Studio, and Stefano Novelli, the show featured a 25' x 14' x 8' multi-dimensional/ shape shifting 3D art installation surrounding Tobin and enveloping him and the audience in a 3D experience. Tobin conceptualized the show as a projection mapped \\\"visual score\\\" to the music from ISAM. The show completed a sold-out 15-show run through US and Canada, in addition to five sold out UK/EU shows. In 2012, ISAM Live returned with a larger tour, starting at Coachella and traveling to Sydney Opera House, London's Brixton Academy, New York's Hammerstein Ballroom, Greek Theatre (Los Angeles), Sonar (Barcelona), as well as full European and US tours throughout summer and fall. In May 2012, Ninja Tune released an Amon Tobin box set (7 x CD, 2 x DVD, 6 x Vinyl, 10\\\").\\nAt the beginning of 2012, Speech Debelle returned to Big Dada, after much critical speculation about leaving the label. She returned from her Mercury Prize win to release another critically acclaimed album, 'Freedom Of Speech,' with - according to Scottish magazine The Skinny - \\\"a verve and vigour that more than justify the early hype\\\". The \\\"refreshingly outspoken\\\" album went on to \\\"trounce all expectations\\\" and was awarded CD of the week by Evening Standard.In 2009, Ninja's longest-serving artist, DJ Food a.k.a. Strictly Kev, released the 2009 EP 'One Man's Weird Is Another Man's World,' and its 2010 follow up 'The Shape Of Things That Hum' made up two-thirds of a forthcoming album. In January 2012, 'The Search Engine' was released as the first DJ Food album in 11 years. As an album release event, DJ Food created his most ambitious live gig to date: a bespoke AV live show for London's only public planetarium, in conjunction with astronomers from The Royal Observatory Greenwich, using art from The Search Engine, images from Kev's own visual archive, plus a wealth of material provided by the astronomers themselves. Kev adapted his content to fit Montreal's Satosphere in July.\\nIn mid 2012, The Bug announced that after \\\"London Zoo,\\\" he set out a new genre and sub-label with Ninja Tune: Acid Ragga. Releasing a set of 7\\\"'s, in June the first Bug track - \\\"Can't Take This No More\\\" - unleashed featuring the legendary Daddy Freddy, while on the flip \\\"Rise Up\\\" featured Inga Copeland of Hype Williams. The \\\"Ganja Baby\\\" 7-inch released shortly afterwards, featuring Daddy Freddy, followed by the 2 x 10\\\" Filthy EP featuring rapper Danny Brown and long time collaborator Flowdan.\\nIn August 2012, London-based band The Invisible dropped their second album, the \\\"cerebral yet instantly accessible\\\"  'Rispah,' on Ninja Tune, having been recorded in Brighton - with producer Richard File. The trio's self-titled debut album (produced by Matthew Herbert) in 2009 was nominated for the Mercury Prize  and selected as critics choice for iTunes album of the year. The band's tongue-in-cheek definition of their style of music is 'Experimental Genre-Spanning Spacepop'.\\nEver the pioneer, Big Dada's \\\"king of Grime\\\"  Wiley was awarded a Genre Spotlight Award for the AIM Independent Music Awards in 2012 for his album Evolve or Be Extinct. FACT Magazine claimed the award made up \\\"for what many perceive to be a Mercury snub for the LP\\\".Ninja Tune scored well at Gilles Peterson's Worldwide Awards 2013, with Brainfeeder winning \\\"Label of the Year\\\" - and Ninja Tune scoring 2nd - with the public vote. Invisible's Rispah also won album of the year.In typical pioneering fashion, in February 2013, Ninja Tune spearheaded the launch of Beat Delete - a new service for out of press vinyl. The demise of Sony DADC warehouse in Edmonton (destroyed during the London riots in the summer of 2011), left many independent labels ravaged. Ninja Tune launched a website Beat Delete as a pledge scheme enabling fans to partially fund the release of rare collectibles.In 2012, Ninja Tune also struck a deal with game developer United Front Games and their publisher Square Enix for their upcoming game Sleeping Dogs. Ninja Tune was featured as a in-game radio channel available to the player during gameplay, one of the ten total. The station featured a select group of works by the real life Ninja Tune record and their then artist lineup, including works by Bonobo, Lorn, Emika, Stateless, Two Fingers, and Cinematic Orchestra among others, for a total of 18 tracks.\\nIn April 2013, Coldcut released Ninja Jamm, an iOS music remix app, in collaboration with London-based arts and technology firm Seeper. Geared toward both casual listeners and more experienced DJs and music producers, the freemium app allows users to download and remix \\\"Tunepacks\\\" that feature original tracks and mixes by Coldcut, as well as other Ninja artists, creating something new altogether. With the \\\"intuitive yet deep\\\" app, users can turn instruments on and off, swap between clips, add glitches and effects, trigger and pitch-bend stabs and one-off samples, and change the tempo of the track instantly. Users can additionally record as they mix and instantly upload to SoundCloud or save the mixes locally. Tunepack releases for Ninja Jamm are increasingly synchronised with Ninja Tune releases on conventional formats. To date over 20 tunepacks have been released, including Amon Tobin, Bonobo, Coldcut, DJ Food, Martyn, Emika, Machinedrum, Raffertie, Irresistible Force, Falty DL.In March 2013, Bonobo unleashed his highly anticipated follow-up to Black Sands, the triumphant and revelatory The North Borders. Hailed as being sumptuous and accomplished, the album featured Erykah Badu, Motion Audio artist Grey Reverend, British singer Szjerdene and Swedish singer-songwriter Cornelia. Visual artist Cyriak's video for Bonobo's \\\"Cirrus\\\" was a cascading visual mantra that hit over 1 million views. The album charted at number 29 on the UK Album Charts. The following November, Bonobo released his contribution to the Late Night Tales series with a 21-track selection, which Bonobo described as ranging \\\"from neo-classical to more abstract electronic pieces to spiritual jazz.\\\" Bonobo's popularity in the live spectrum continues to grow, having sold out a Roundhouse Ninja Tune festival in 2013 and Sydney Opera House. He has a live performance scheduled at Alexandra Palace in November 2014.\\nAnother popular Ninja Tune artist, Travis Stewart, a.k.a. NYC/Berlin artist Machinedrum signed up with the label in 2013, first releasing Eyesdontlie that July, a single which XLR8R donned \\\"quite possibly deeper and more ambitious than anything we've heard from Stewart to date\\\". After releasing a second 12\\\" (\\\"Gunshotta Ave\\\") the following month, Machinedrum released his full LP Vapor City at the end of September 2013. A visceral album about an imaginary metropolis, Vapor City received much acclaim from critics and DJs alike, even landing three live performances on the Boiler Room (New York, Berlin and London). Machinedrum claimed it was his biggest and boldest project to date.In January 2014, Big Dada released a deluxe European edition of Killer Mike and El-P's Run the Jewels album, featuring new artwork, a new colour vinyl LP + 12\\\" release plus deluxe CD and download editions.\\nNinja Tune also released Actress' fourth album, Ghettoville in January 2014. The exquisiteIn April 2014, new Ninja Tune signing Kelis released a raw soul record entirely produced by TV on the Radio's Dave Sitek. Kelis says of the signing: \\\"I'm really happy to be partnering with Ninja Tune on my new record. This is the album I've wanted to make for a long time.\\\"\\nIn May 2014, \\\"UK festival favorite\\\" Mr Scruff released his fifth LP on Ninja Tune, entitled Friendly Bacteria. Meanwhile, The Bug is continuing his series of \\\"Acid Ragga\\\" singles throughout 2014, leading up to his next full length later in the year, Angels & Devils. Names that The Bug has worked with on the project (in addition to Inga Copeland and Daddy Freddy) include Death Grips, Gonjasufi, Grouper, JK Flesh (Godflesh/Jesu), The Spaceape, Flowdan, Warrior Queen and Earth's Dylan Carlson.\\nOn 2 November 2014, Young Fathers' \\\"Dead\\\" entered the official top 100 UK album chart for the first time, four days after their Mercury success, debuting at 35.\\nOn October 30th 2015, Big Dada's Roots Manuva released his 9th studio album entitled ''Bleeds_(Roots_Manuva_album)'', receiving positive reviews in most publications, currently holding a 80% score on Metacritic. Kamasi Washington debut solo recording, The Epic, was released in May 2015 via Flying Lotus' Brainfeeder to critical acclaim. It appeared on numerous 'Best of 2015' lists, including publications such as NPR Music, The Guardian, Pitchfork, Vice's Noisey, MOJO, Uncut, Rolling Stone and many more. Bonobo released his sixth album, Migration, in January 2017. It was announced on 3 November 2016 with the release of the single \\\"Kerala\\\" and an official video. \\nThe official video for the single is directed by Bison (Jon Hopkins/London Grammar/Rosie Lowe), featuring lead Gemma Arterton (Quantum of Solace/Inside No. 9). The album artwork was designed by Neil Krug (Boards of Canada/Lana Del Rey). The album features Nick Murphy, Rhye, Innov Gnawa and Hundred Waters.  The album and the track \\\"Bambro Koyo Ganda\\\" were nominated for the 60th Annual Grammy Awards for Best Dance Recording and Best Dance/Electronic Album. The album peaked higher in the UK chart (number 5) and in the US (number 59). In 2018, Bonobo's \\\"Migration\\\" album also won Album of the Year at the 2017 Electronic Music Awards and Bonobo was also nominated for Live Act of the Year. Around the release of the album, Bonobo performed sold out shows at venues such as Brixton Academy and Alexandra Palace.After signing to Ninja Tune in 2017, Belfast based duo Bicep released their long-awaited debut album Bicep, which reached the Top 20 of the UK Album Charts and received positive reviews on its release, with support from publications such as Pitchfork, The Guardian, Resident Advisor and a cover feature on Mixmag.

This earned Peggy a place on publication Dazed's top 100 artists of the year. Following the release of the 'Audio Track 5' EP and live performances at the Strelka Institute (Moscow), Barbican Centre and the Tate Modern, electronic producer and musician Darren Cunningham AKA Actress and the London Contemporary Orchestra are to released a full album of their collaboration on the 25th of May 2018 entitled 'LAGEOS'.

The album currently holds a 82% rating on Metacritic indicating \\\"Universal acclaim\\\", with five star write ups in publications such as The Guardian.\\n\\n\\n== Design ==\\nAs the imprint grew, Ninja grew into an 'anti-corporate' brand, supporting the work of visual artists, filmmakers, and mavericks of all media, running its own club nights and helping disseminate the work of its artists across the globe. From its very beginnings, Ninja Tune sought a strong visual identity, thanks to Michael Bartalos (whose original logo was a monochrome woodcut of a hooded ninja brandishing his long sword) and Mark Porter, Matt Black's friend from Oxford, Ninja's first art director who defined the logo and overall aesthetic (in addition to creating Ninja's striking yellow and black in-house record bags), and subsequently became Art Director at The Guardian. It was the arrival of Kevin Foakes as in-house designer in 1994 that developed the logo to its current international recognition, and became largely responsible for some of the label's most iconic artwork. Working as Openmind, Foakes has designed many of Ninja's album sleeves, including memorable covers for Amon Tobin, Coldcut and Funki Porcini's 2002 album Fast Asleep. He's also commissioned acclaimed outside talent for a number of key projects.\\nFoakes' Ninja logo has found its way in diverse remix forms onto DJ bags (the \\\"Wax Sack\\\"), cigarette lighters, T-shirts, turntable slip-mats, iPod skins (bearing the slogan \\\"Remember vinyl?\\\"), sunglasses by Japanese company Less Than Human and the label's own brand of cigarette rolling papers (\\\"Ninja Skins\\\"). French urban vinyl specialists Rolito also marketed a Foakes-designed toy Ninja, who came armed with a 3\\\" CD of Ninja Tunes.\\nEwan Robertson (a.k.a. Offshore) and Oscar Bauer, were integral co-designers for Ninja Tune or Big Dada, responsible for iconic covers such as the Wiley 'black playground' image for Playtime Is Over, the Roots Manuva slime-head for Slime & Reason and Bonobo's Black Sands triptych.\\nSome Ninja Tune artists, meanwhile, design their own sleeves, such as Mr Scruff, whose cartoon illustrations are emblazoned across much of his catalogue and merchandise. Another prodigious cartoonist who designs his own sleeves is Kid Koala, whose Nufonia Must Fall graphic novel was published in 2003 by ECW Press in association with Ninja Tune, and whose 2000 debut album, Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, and its 2003 follow-up Some of My Best Friends Are DJs came accompanied by Koala-illustrated comic books.\\nOther unique promotional Ninja Tune items include Coldcut's Top Trump-inspired Control Cards, Amon Tobin ear-plugs, Kid Koala-illustrated playing cards, Mr Scruff-designed jigsaw puzzles, Scruff-branded tins of tuna-in-brine (to promote his 2008 LP Ninja Tuna, which was available pre-loaded on a tuna-shaped USB stick), The Heavy and TTC-branded condoms, and plastic travelcard wallets emblazoned with artwork from Big Dada's Well Deep compilation and Roots Manuva's Slime & Reason album.\\nMore recently, as part of Ninja Tune's 20th Anniversary in 2010, 3500 Ninja Tune XX box sets were released, all housed in limited edition hi-spec packaging designed and conceived by Ninja artwork legend Openmind. In May 2013, golden ticket holders for Bonobo's Camden Roundhouse gig in London were given a limited edition 12\\\" for Bonobo's \\\"Cirrus\\\", which came in gatefold plastic cover with \\\"zoetrope\\\" viewer stand and art print, with picture disc art by Cyriak. In January 2014, Werkdiscs boss Actress released a boxset for a collection of photos presented by Hard Format, which included Ghettoville as vinyl and CD, as well as--for the first time on vinyl--a 2 LP white vinyl edition of Hazyville and CD. The boxset also contained a 40-page artbook, all carefully encased in a black \\\"elephant-skinned\\\" outer box.\\n\\n\\n== Solid Steel ==\\nPre-dating Ninja Tune is the legendary and world-famous radio show Solid Steel, which Coldcut set up in 1988 and joined at a later date by DJ Food and DK. What initially began as a radio show on then-pirate Kiss FM went on to become a weekly 2 hour mix show broadcast online and syndicated to numerous radio stations around the world, with highlights available as a podcast on iTunes. Solid Steel is also the name of a series of DJ mix CDs from the label and various club nights showcasing the talents of the Solid Steel DJ's and a number of Ninja Tune artists.\\nThe show, which celebrated its 25th anniversary in 2013, showcases a varied blend of left field tunes, the broadest beats and forward-thinking selections. Being a freestyle eclectic mix, the weekly two-hour show was described by The Quietus as being \\\"the past mashed with the present plus a dash of the future\\\".In addition to Solid Steel, Ninja Tune has conducted regular podcast interviews with their roster under the name The Ninja Tune Podcast. \\n\\n\\n== Big Dada ==\\nHip hop label Big Dada was set up by journalist and writer Will Ashon in 1997. Big Dada was created with a similarly open-minded remit to sister label Ninja Tune, traversing the boundaries between hip hop, grime and ragga. Born out of a frustration over acts going unappreciated elsewhere, Big Dada swiftly cemented itself as a force in its own right. The name came up in reference to Ashon's love of Kool Keith, who he'd described in print as the \\\"Mac Dada\\\", as a combination of mac daddy and Dadaism.Big Dada began releasing 12\\\"'s in the summer of 1997, the first couple of which were produced by Luke Vibert. The label's debut release, Misanthropic, featured Alpha Prhyme, a.k.a. Juice Aleem, soon to become a member of crew New Flesh for Old, who would release their own Electronic Bombardment on Big Dada that September. Since then, Big Dada has become home of some of the most maverick, forward-thinking and innovative artists in hip hop and beyond, including essential British hip hop artist Roots Manuva (Mercury Prize nominee), Mercury Prize winner Speech Debelle, UK hip hop artist TY (whose 2003 Upwards album was also Mercury nominated) and grime pioneer Wiley. Roots Manuva's album releases have been integral to the label, including Brand New Second Hand, Run Come Save Me, Awfully Deep, Slime & Reason and 4everevolution. Other notable artists include Diplo, cLOUDDEAD, Juice Aleem, DELS, Young Fathers (Mercury Prize Winner 2014) and Spank Rock, with a roster that's as prolific as it is varied. In the words of The Guardian, \\\"heaven help the music hack who tries to pigeonhole Big Dada's output\\\".\\n\\n\\n== Brainfeeder ==\\nBrainfeeder is an independent record label based in Los Angeles, California, founded by Warp Records recording artist Flying Lotus in 2008, focusing on electronic music and instrumental hip hop amongst other styles of music.\\n\\n\\n== Werkdiscs ==\\nWerkdiscs (formerly spelt as Werk Discs) is a British independent record label based in London. Originally a club night started by Darren J. Cunningham a.k.a. Actress, Ben Casey and Gavin Weale in the early 2000s,[11] Werkdiscs released their first record in the summer of 2004.\\n\\n\\n== Ntone ==\\nIn 1994, Ninja Tune's first sister imprint was Ntone, a label that initially specialised in avant-garde music and in more electronically inclined ambience. Artists on the roster included Animals on Wheels, Cabbageboy, Hexstatic and Neotropic. Ntone was, in the words of Peter Quicke, \\\"for ambient and techno and other stuff that didn't quite fit Ninja Tune, but which we really liked, and didn't want to restrict ourselves from releasing.\\\" A collision of spacey dub and chilled ambient house, the first release was AntiStatic (TONE 1) by Hex released in February 1994, and last one Sunflower Girl (NTONE 45) by Neotropic in 2001.\\n\\n\\n== Current artists and alumni ==\\n\\n\\n=== Ninja Tune: Current ===\\n\\nYoung Fathers\\n\\n\\n=== Ninja Tune: Alumni ===\\n\\n\\n=== Big Dada: Current ===\\n\\n\\n=== Big Dada: Alumni

His labels have included Acid Jazz, Talkin' Loud, and Brownswood Recordings. Peterson has been associated with the careers of artists of the 1990s, such as Erykah Badu, Roni Size, and Jamiroquai.\\nPeterson started his career on pirate radio stations.

He hosts a syndicated radio program that is broadcast in seven European countries.\\nPeterson became popular on SoundCloud with a follower base of more than 3 million listeners, featuring mixes and artists from his label Brownswood Recordings.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\nBorn in France to a mother from Paris, France, and a father from Zurich, Switzerland, Gilles Peterson moved to the UK very young and attended the Roman Catholic John Fisher School. He became known on the London circuit as a DJ specialising in the new breed of \\\"acid jazz\\\", drawing on the jazz, funk and Latin fusions (including Brazilian music) of the 1970s. First heard as a DJ on the London pirate radio station Radio Invicta, he went on to host Mad On Jazz on BBC Radio London in 1986-87, then ran club night at Dingwalls in Camden Town. Upon leaving BBC London in 1986, Peterson took up a new residency at Dingwalls in Camden, which ran for five years. Coinciding with the rise of acid house in UK clubland, the popularity of Sunday Afternoon at Dingwalls grew and grew, establishing itself as a legendary session. This was just one among many other significant clubs with which Peterson was associated: Special Branch, Electric Ballroom, Wag Club, Babylon at Heaven, Fez, Talking Loud at the Fridge and not forgetting That's How It Is at Bar Rumba and his long association with Plastic People. Peterson now curates a number of extraordinary live music events in the UK and internationally including the Worldwide Festival in the south of France, now in its 10th year.\\n\\n\\n== Dingwalls ==\\nThat club, and one of Peterson's best remembered club sessions, was Talkin' Loud Sayin' Something at the old Dingwalls club in Camden, North West London which ran from the late 1980s until March 1991. The sessions were characterised by jazz dancers in suits hats and spats, well-known jazz dance classics including tracks from Yusef Lateef, Pharoah Sanders, Freddie Hubbard, Airto, Herbie Hancock, and the anthemic In The Fast Lane by Jean-Luc Ponty; but the jazz was fused with hip-hop and the more experimental tracks. Peterson played alongside fellow London DJ Patrick Forge at most of the Dingwalls' sessions, as well as separately at many other underground club nights and music weekenders. On 8 October 2006, both Peterson and Forge played the first of many annual reunion shows at the old site of Dingwalls (now a Jongleurs comedy club), with a compilation album of popular tracks from the club also being released at the same time in 2006 entitled Sunday Afternoon At Dingwalls.\\n\\n\\n== Jazz FM ==\\nIn March 1990, Peterson became a disc jockey on London's first-ever dedicated jazz station 102.2 Jazz FM. The three-hour show was stripped into sections including the \\\"Samba 60\\\" and the \\\"Vibrazone\\\". Artists as diverse as the Freestyle Fellowship, Sergio Mendes and Leon Thomas would all appear on the same playlist. He was forced to leave the station after making anti-war comments during the first Gulf War.\\n\\n\\n== Kiss 100 FM ==\\nSeptember 1990 saw London pirate dance music station Kiss 100 FM become legal when it acquired a licence and started to broadcast from the Holloway Road in North London. Patrick Forge was then given the space to create his own show, with the two DJs continuing to work together at Dingwalls until the \\\"last dance\\\" on 3 March 1991. Peterson moved over to Kiss FM himself after being fired by Jazz FM. In his shows on Kiss FM he played acts as diverse as Josh Wink, Gang Starr and Horace Silver in the space of a single programme. He was then hired by BBC Radio 1 in 1998.\\n\\n\\n== Radio 1 ==\\nFrom 1998 to 2012, through his BBC show Worldwide - which was originally produced by longtime collaborator Benji B, Karen P (Folded Wing), Ben Cave, Beccy Grierson, Alex Kenning and currently Dave O'Donnell - Peterson continued to present a wide range of music that may be new to its young audiences. The show always presented a combination of new, older and often very rare records from the late 1950s to 1980s. Every three months or so, Peterson dedicated a whole show to older vinyl releases in a special version of his show he subtitles as Brownswood Basement; two associated compilation albums with the same name containing older personal classics have been released on the United States label Ubiquity Records's offshoot Luv N' Haight. He has been associated with two Brownswood labels - the name comes from the road in north London where his house was located. This building is now primarily a place Peterson uses to store his huge record collection. In August 2004 the show moved from Wednesday (midnight till 2 am) to an earlier Sunday slot (11 pm to 1 am) with a spectacular live outside broadcast from The Big Chill at Eastnor Castle Herefordshire featuring Bugz In The Attic performing a DJ set, and interviews with house DJ Tom Middleton and Mr. Scruff.\\nOne of the highlights of the new format BBC Radio 1 show was the special sessions from the BBC's Maida Vale Studios. These have included artists such as Roots Manuva, Bjork and Floating Points. In September 2006, Peterson's show on Radio 1 was moved from Sunday night to Tuesday night/Wednesday morning between 2 am and 4 am. The first show included a live appearance from Lupe Fiasco.\\nIn 2002 he released a compilation album, Impressed with Gilles Peterson, featuring rare and forgotten British Jazz from the 1950-1960s, that Peterson had collected over the years. This led to many of the records being re-released to a new audience. This in turn led to a series of concerts featuring some of the artists and a documentary about the history of British jazz (Jazz Britannia).In late 2011 Peterson announced that after 13 years at the station he would be leaving BBC Radio 1, following his last show in the early hours of Wednesday 28 March and moving to a new show on BBC Radio 6 Music.\\n\\n\\n== Radio 6 Music ==\\nFollowing his departure from Radio 1, Peterson started a new three-hour Saturday afternoon show on BBC Radio 6 Music, beginning on Saturday 7 April 2012, running weekly from 3 to 6 pm, and giving him an extra hour of broadcast time. Like his previous Radio 1 programme, it is made by independent production company Somethin' Else for the BBC.\\n\\n\\n== J-WAVE ==\\nPeterson has been producing and broadcasting original radio shows for Japan. He had daily 15 minute music program on J-WAVE (81.3FM), Tokyo's Finest FM Station. Daily program \\\"Worldwide 15\\\" run Mondays-Thursdays from 4:05 to 4:20 pm from 2005 to 2011. The show was highly received and made many radio hits. Music event of the program \\\"Worldwide Showcase\\\" became annual events and each year which featured DJs and Live acts from Japan and outer national. The event was curated under particular theme each year (2006 - 1 year anniversary, 2008- 3rd Anniversary, 2009 - AFRO-CUBAN FLAVA, 2010 - Galaxy Session, 2011 - Love Supreme, 2012 - Six Sense).\\n\\n\\n== Worldwide Awards ==\\n\\nThe Worldwide Awards is an annual event wherein Gilles Peterson chooses his favourite records of the year. His listeners then vote for the top 10 via the Radio 1 website. The event has been held at London venues including Cargo and KoKo with full broadcast coverage by Radio 1, and has expanded to include sections such as \\\"Best Clubnight\\\", \\\"Best Record Shop\\\", \\\"Best Compilation Album\\\", and a special award called \\\"The John Peel'Play More Jazz' Award\\\" given to an artist, often a newcomer, who has displayed special noteworthy work over the year.\\n\\n\\n== Mistral Productions ==\\nPeterson is the creative director of Mistral Productions, launched in November 2013, which produces his internationally syndicated radio shows as well as audio and video content for brands.\\n\\n\\n== Record labels ==\\nPeterson has been involved in founding four record labels. In 1987, together with DJ Baz Fe Jazz, he was recruited by Ace Records to create the soul, funk and jazz dance sub-label BGP Records. In 1988 he and Eddie Piller founded Acid Jazz Records, a label whose roster included the Brand New Heavies, Jamiroquai, Corduroy, the James Taylor Quartet and Snowboy. After growing disillusionment with the scene that grew up around the label, he went on to run Talkin' Loud, enlisting the help of fellow DJ Norman Jay, who formed his own Global Village label. The Talkin' Loud roster included Nuyorican Soul (a side project of the producers Masters At Work), Courtney Pine, MJ Cole, Young Disciples, Incognito, Terry Callier, The Roots, Galliano and Roni Size's project Reprazent.\\nPeterson's most recent record label, Brownswood Recordings, was launched in 2006. The label's early releases includes the likes of British singer/songwriter Ben Westbeech, 45-piece orchestral ensemble The Heritage Orchestra, Japanese punk jazz band Soil & \\\"Pimp\\\" Sessions, Brooklyn-based pianist Elan Mehler and jazz vocalist Jose James. More recently, they've released music by Zara McFarlane, Ghostpoet's Mercury Prize-nominated debut and their long-running compilation series, compiled by Peterson, called Brownswood Bubblers.\\nThe label is sometimes confused with a different imprint called Brownswood Records, which released music from Japanese bands like United Future Organization.\\n\\n\\n== Steve Reid Foundation ==\\nIn 2011, he founded the Steve Reid Foundation in memory of the legendary jazz drummer. Having witnessed Reid's suffering with illness and hardship, Gilles set up the charity to raise money for musicians in need. Since then, they've collaborated with Help Musicians UK to help musicians who are in need of support. More recently, a collaboration with the PRS Foundation has seen grants and mentoring provided to new artists. Gilles ran the 2011 London Marathon, raising just under PS7,000 for Help Musicians UK, followed by the 2016 New York Marathon, where he raised over $21,000 for the Steve Reid Foundation.\\n\\n\\n== Festivals ==\\n\\nPeterson has made many regular appearances at music festivals across the world including Lovebox in east London, The Big Chill in Hereford and the Southport Weekender in the north west of England. Away from the UK he has appeared at the Exit Festival in Serbia, INmusic festival in Croatia, and in 2006 the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival. Peterson also curated his own stage at Montreux Jazz Festival for 10 years during the 1990s. Recently he has appeared in festivals such as Tramlines, Standon Calling, Summerstage, Slide Festival and Odyssia Festival, where he gave a spontaneous interview sharing some interesting thoughts about music and festivals.\\nPeterson and Freshly Cut, a French event production company from Montpellier, collaborated to create the \\\"Worldwide Festival\\\". This started out as a small intimate festival during the summertime in the coastal town of Sete in France in 2006. It was expanded to include a winter versions which is now hosted in the Swiss Alps - Leysin.\\n\\n\\n== Production ==\\nIn the world of production, Peterson has collaborated with Switch and DJ Clipz in the past, and most recently Peterson produced two tracks for Roberto Fonseca's Grammy-nominated album Yo. Peterson also produced Danay Suarez's album and has remixed artists such as Raphael Gualazzi, The Bees and Fatoumata Diawara and most recently Gregory Porter's Grammy-winning album Liquid Spirit alongside Alex Patchwork. Peterson continues to develop his studio sound with his in-house partner Simbad.\\n\\n\\n== Sonzeira ==\\nReleased in May 2014 via Talkin' Loud / Virgin EMI, Sonzeira's Brasil Bam Bam Bam is a journey through the different flavours of authentic Brazilian music culture.\\nSonzeira is the collective name for the group of Brazilian artists who feature on the album. Peterson turned from DJ to producer for this ambitious venture, settling in Rio de Janeiro with young UK production associates Sam Shepherd (Floating Points); Dilip Harris and Rob Gallagher from 2 Banks of 4; and Kassin from Rio collective Orquestra Imperial. The album features Brazilian artists such as Seu Jorge and Elza Soares.\\nAlong with the album, there was a documentary film celebrating the creation and release of \\\"Sonzeira: Brasil Bam Bam Bam\\\". Titled \\\"Bam Bam Bam: The Story of Sonzeira\\\", this two-hour documentary was directed by Charlie Inman and Ben Holman and shot in 2014 by Mother London and Rio de Janeiro's Beija Films. The film was also distributed in Tokyo, Japan by Sha-la-la Company and raised money for Fight For Peace (Luta Pela Paz), organization founded in Complexo da Mare, Rio de Janeiro, as a direct response to youth-involvement in drug-related crime and violence.\\n\\n\\n== Havana Cultura ==\\n2009 saw the birth of a new collaborative project and long-term partnership between Peterson and Havana Club or \\\"Havana Cultura\\\". Havana Cultura is a global initiative developed by Havana Club International that gives a platform to Cuban artists from all disciplines. The website, www.havana-cultura.com, was launched in 2007.\\nPeterson and Brownswood's involvement began two years later, resulting in four album releases and three international tours.\\nHavana Cultura: New Cuba Sound was the first album to come out of the project, released in 2010. Travelling to Cuba in 2009, Peterson teamed up with the award-winning Cuban jazz pianist Roberto Fonseca to find the best up-and-coming musical talent in Havana. The double CD album was a celebration of Cuba's musical forces spanning Latin, Afro jazz and fusion to hip-hop, funk, reggaeton and soul.\\nIn support of this project, Peterson began a European tour in June/July 2010, accompanied by Fonseca, his band and vocalists Danay Suarez, Ogguere and Obsesion. This was the first of three tours organised in close collaboration with Havana Club. The Gilles Peterson Havana Cultura band has now travelled through Europe and beyond with shows in London (Barbican), Paris, Amsterdam, Istanbul, Berlin and Madrid, as well as many festivals.\\nTravelling with the rest of the 2011 crew, Mala (Digital Mystikz) was also invited to Cuba with Peterson to record and collaborate with local musicians as part of the ongoing Havana Cultura project. The results are found on the album Mala in Cuba, which was released on Brownswood Recordings in partnership with Havana Cultura on 10 September 2012.\\n\\n\\n== Worldwide FM ==\\nA new global music-radio platform launched by Gilles Peterson in September 2016. Following the success of the Grand Theft Auto V in-game radio station of the same name, WorldWide FM has expanded into the real world with Peterson and Thris Tian hosting shows alongside a hand-picked roster of the finest DJs and selectors from five continents. Since the launch, the station has gone out on the road broadcasting across Europe, the US and Asia, with pop-ups in Amsterdam (ADE), Los Angeles (How We Do LA), Marseille (Le Gallette), Milan (Jazzmi Festival), Paris (Le Mellotron), Tokyo (HMV Shibuya), and closer to home, at the 1:54 Contemporary African Art Fair (Somerset House). The station is Powered by WeTransfer and broadcasting from The Pyramid radio studios in north London.\\nURL: https://www.worldwidefm.net/\\n\\n\\n== WeTransfer ==\\nPeterson is the creative director of WeTransfer, a cloud-based computer file transfer service based in Amsterdam, Netherlands. As Creative Director, Peterson gets involved with a number of forthcoming projects such as developing the third season of The Creative Class film series by returning to Cuba to explore the creative scene over there, as well as embarking on a number of film and music projects.

It was founded in 1978 by Jay Levin, who served as president and editor until 1991. Voice Media Group sold the paper in late 2017 to Semanal Media LLC. \\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nAccording to its website, LA Weekly has been the premier source for award-winning coverage of Los Angeles music, arts, film, theater, culture, concerts, [and] events.\\\" The LA Weekly also recognizes outstanding small theatre productions (99 seats or less) in Los Angeles, with their annual LA Weekly Theater Awards, established in 1979. Starting in 2006, LA Weekly has hosted the LA Weekly Detour Music Festival every October. The entire block surrounding Los Angeles City Hall is closed off to accommodate the festival's three stages.Some of its most famous writers were Pulitzer Prize-winning food writer Jonathan Gold, who left in early 2012, and Nikki Finke, who blogged about the film industry through the Weekly's website and published a print column in the paper each week, leaving in June 2009 after the blog she founded, Deadline Hollywood Daily, was acquired by an online firm.The paper was founded in 1978 by Jay Levin, who served as its editor from 1978 to 1991 and its president from 1978 to 1992. The paper's reputation took a huge hit, after a review of the 1995 flop Houseguest, where they questionably quoted the movie was \\\"Outlandishly Funny!\\\".  Levin put together an investment group that included actor Michael Douglas, Burt Kleiner, Joe Benadon and Pete Kameron.  The majority of its core of initial staff members came from the Austin Sun, a similar-natured bi-weekly, which had recently ceased publication.Although some former employees have complained about personnel moves since the Weekly's parent company's acquisition by New Times Media in 1996 (which assumed the Village Voice Media name in 2005), the paper has won a Pulitzer Prize, and broke the story of the \\\"Grim Sleeper\\\" serial killer. Some of those disgruntled ex-employees complained when New Times replaced news editor Alan Mittelstaedt with veteran New Times editor Jill Stewart. But in the 2009 LA Press Club Awards, the Weekly won six first-place awards, including three by staff writer Christine Pelisek, who was honored as the city's best reporter in investigative reporting, hard news, and news feature.\\nHarold Meyerson, once the Weekly's political editor, charged in a departing email to Weekly staffers in 2006 that the new owners had grafted a cookie-cutter template for editorial content onto the publication.Writers once closely associated with the Weekly but let go by the paper's current management include Meyerson, classical music critic Alan Rich, theater critic Steven Leigh Morris, film critic Ella Taylor, and columnist Marc Cooper. Internal cut backs have resulted in the paper eliminating the position of managing editor, letting go several staff writers and other editorial department positions, as well as cutting the entire fact checking department. On June 1, 2009, the paper announced that Editor-in-Chief Laurie Ochoa, who began helming the paper in 2001 (before the New Times acquisition), was \\\"parting ways\\\" with the Weekly. On that same day, ads for her replacement appeared on Craigslist and Journalismjobs.com. Though some speculated that Stewart was a shoo-in for the position, the job quickly went to Drex Heikes, formerly of the Los Angeles Times. When Heikes left in 2011, he was replaced by Sarah Fenske.Weekly management said staff cuts were necessary due to poor economic conditions. However, some of the cuts are likely attributable to philosophical differences with the paper's then-owners, who have since sold the chain. Former staff writer Matthew Fleischer said at the time that \\\"as part of the company's 'plug-and-play' management strategy, editors, writers and ad directors were moved from city to city within the chain, without regard for local knowledge. Any old-school Village Voice Media manager who resisted the metamorphosis was denounced as a 'lefty,' a 'throwback,' and worse. They were fired or simply fled.\\\"Since 2008, LA Weekly has hosted a food and wine festival, now dubbed The Essentials, that draws sizable crowds. In 2009, former 'Los Angeles Times food writer Amy Scattergood became food blogger at LA Weekly's Squid Ink, and was later promoted to food editor. In late 2009, the paper hired Dennis Romero, formerly of Ciudad magazine, as a full-time news blogger. Following the recession, in 2012 the paper added food critic Besha Rodell, a James Beard nominee and former food editor of Atlanta's Creative Loafing.  Then in 2013, LA Weekly named Amy Nicholson as its lead film critic. In 2016, LA Weekly named multimedia journalist and Emmy-winning producer Drew Tewksbury as managing editor.In September 2012, Village Voice Media executives Scott Tobias, Christine Brennan and Jeff Mars bought Village Voice Meda's papers and associated web properties from its founders and formed Voice Media Group. The paper won journalism awards before and after this transition, with two of its news writers, Patrick Range McDonald and Gene Maddaus, winning the Los Angeles Press Club's nod for Journalist of the Year.For a time in the Los Angeles market, LA Weekly competed against two now-defunct publications, including Brand X (a weekly published by the Los Angeles Times and  produced by a crew that included former LA Weekly staffers) and LA CityBeat, a smaller alternative weekly newspaper owned by Southland Publishing, which ceased publication in March 2009. Southland also owns the Pasadena Weekly, (helmed by veteran LA-area newsman Kevin Uhrich) and The Argonaut on the Westside of Los Angeles, and other print products in Southern California.In November 2017, the publication was sold to Semanal Media LLC.\\nIn December 2017, it was revealed that the new owners of Semanal Media LLC are men from Orange County and include \\\"David Welch, a Los Angeles-based attorney with ties to the cannabis industry; philanthropist Kevin Xu, an investor with biotech firm Mebo International; attorney Steve Mehr; boutique hotelier Paul Makarechian; real estate developer Mike Mugel; and Southern California investor Andy Bequer.\\\" The new operation manager is Brian Calle.In August 2018 David Welch sued the other co-owners. \\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\n\\nOfficial website\", \"rev_id\": 857234727, \"accessed\": \"2018-09-03 00:23:59.864295\", \"links\": [\"Pulitzer Prize\", \"Harold Meyerson\", \"Semanal Media LLC\", \"Jill Stewart\", \"Los Angeles, California\", \"Marc Cooper\", \"Journalismjobs.com\", \"LA CityBeat\", \"LA Weekly Theater Award\", \"Village Voice Media\", \"Los Angeles City Hall\", \"Craigslist\", \"Ella Taylor\", \"Jonathan Gold\", \"Jay Levin\", \"Nikki Finke\", \"Alan Rich\", \"New Times Media\", \"Michael Douglas\", \"Voice Media Group\", \"LA Weekly Detour Music Festival\", \"Austin Sun\", \"Steven Leigh Morris\", \"California\"]}, {\"title\": \"Ras G\", \"link_id\": \"Ras G\", \"summary\": \"Gregory Shorter, Jr. (born 1979-1980), better known by his stage name Ras G, is an instrumental hip hop producer and DJ from Los Angeles, California.He is associated with the record label Brainfeeder established by fellow producer Flying Lotus as well as Poo-Bah Records, a label Ras G co-founded with partners Ron Stivers and multi-genre music producer Black Monk.\", \"content\": \"Gregory Shorter, Jr. (born 1979-1980), better known by his stage name Ras G, is an instrumental hip hop producer and DJ from Los Angeles, California.He is associated with the record label Brainfeeder established by fellow producer Flying Lotus as well as Poo-Bah Records, a label Ras G co-founded with partners Ron Stivers and multi-genre music producer Black Monk.\\n\\n\\n== Career ==\\nRas G released Brotha from Anotha Planet in 2009.

His pseudonym is a corruption of the French oiseau, meaning \\\"bird\\\". He is currently signed to Ed Banger Records and Brainfeeder. Dupieux uses his full name for his cinematographic work, Mr. Oizo being only used for his musical work.\\n\\n\\n== Early life ==\\nQuentin Dupieux was born on 15 April 1974 in Paris. At the age of 18, he found a camera and started taking photographs. At 19, he began to play music to illustrate his images, and he bought his first synthesizer. In 1999, Laurent Garnier of the record label FCom bought a car from Mr. Oizo's father. Garnier then found out about Dupieux's talents and let him direct the music video for his song \\\"Flashback\\\". Later, Dupieux was signed to FCom, which he released his first EP, \\\"#1\\\".\\n\\n\\n== Career ==\\n\\n\\n=== \\\"Flat Beat\\\" ===\\nDupieux released \\\"Flat Beat\\\" in January 1999, a track consisting mainly of a repeated bass loop and a drum sample from \\\"Put Your Love in My Tender Care\\\" by The Fatback Band. In an interview with XLR8R magazine, Dupieux stated that it took him only two hours with a Korg MS-20 to produce. However, Flat Beat became a hit throughout Europe in 1999, becoming the best-known Mr. Oizo release. The track was featured in a series of Levi's jeans TV commercials, which featured a yellow puppet named Flat Eric nodding his head to the rhythm while riding in an old, beat-up Chevelle. Flat Eric was also featured in the song's music video. The Flat Beat EP has sold over three million copies. The song reached number 1 in the UK.\\n\\n\\n=== Analog Worms Attack ===\\nAfter \\\"Flat Beat\\\", Oizo spent two months creating his first full album, Analog Worms Attack, which was released in 1999. The album's name was derived from the album's production - it was composed entirely using analog equipment. The record scratching effects were provided by Mr. Oizo's friend Feadz. \\\"Flat Beat\\\" appeared as a bonus track after the five minutes of silence following the final track \\\"Analog Wormz Sequel\\\". There are a total of three singles off of this album. A version of \\\"No Day Massacre\\\" without any record scratching exists on the Flat Beat EP, titled \\\"Monday Massacre\\\".\\n\\n\\n=== Moustache (Half a Scissor) ===\\nMoustache (Half a Scissor) was Mr. Oizo's second studio album. Released in 2005, the album was composed exclusively using computers as he had by that time decided to eschew the use of analog equipment. The extensive time it took to remodel his studio and master the use of computers in composing electronic music is cited as the reason for the long hiatus between Analog Worms Attack and Moustache (Half a Scissor). Before its public release, a promo CD was released onto the internet featuring three tracks not on the original release: \\\"CPU\\\",\\\"Nazis\\\", and \\\"A Nun.\\\"\\nSome songs on the promo differ from the released album versions. For example, \\\"Nurse Bob\\\" is much longer on the final release whilst the promo version splices vocal samples into a much shorter version. This is his only album not to have its debut release on vinyl; in January 2011 it was released through Brainfeeder.\\n\\n\\n=== Ed Banger Records ===\\n\\nMr. Oizo's first EP released on Ed Banger Records is called \\\"Transsexual\\\". The EP features the track \\\"Patrick122\\\", which is a re-working of the 1979 disco track \\\"Do It at the Disco\\\" by Gary's Gang. The track appeared on Mr. Oizo's MySpace page in 2006 under the title Patrick122.\\nOn 16 October 2008, his MySpace page had another video appear: a promo for his upcoming album, Lambs Anger. The first single off the Record was \\\"Positif\\\", which was released 3 days after Lambs Anger. On 15 March 2009, the second single off the album was released, Pourriture, whose EP features some reworked titles by Oizo himself and a remix of Erreur Jean by Arveene and Misk.\\n\\n\\n=== Lambs Anger ===\\nLambs Anger is Mr. Oizo's first studio album released by Ed Banger Records, the label he chose after his split with F Communications, who notoriously referred to Moustache (Half a Scissor) as \\\"unlistenable\\\". \\\"Positif\\\" and \\\"Pourriture\\\" were chosen as the album's singles. It includes a track, \\\"Steroids\\\", which features his label-mate Uffie. The track \\\"Two Takes It\\\" is a cover of the song \\\"It Takes Two\\\" by Rob Base and DJ E-Z Rock that features samples of \\\"Let's Start The Dance\\\" by Hamilton Bohannon; the song also features an unknown artist by the name of \\\"Carmen Castro\\\".\\n\\n\\n=== Collaborations with Uffie ===\\nMr. Oizo and Uffie first collaborated on her second single, \\\"Ready to Uff\\\", in 2006. Since then he has produced the following tracks for Uffie: \\\"Dismissed\\\", \\\"Hot Chick\\\", \\\"F1rst Love\\\" (which charted at number 18 in Belgium), \\\"Steroids\\\" and \\\"MCs Can Kiss\\\".\\nMr. Oizo provided both production work and songwriting for Uffie's 2010 debut album, Sex Dreams and Denim Jeans. He worked alongside Feadz, SebastiAn, Mirwais, J-Mat and Uffie to produce and write the album. He produced the first single from the album, \\\"MCs Can Kiss\\\", which peaked at number 48 Japan and 97 in France. He also produced the tracks \\\"Art of Uff\\\", \\\"F1rst Love\\\", \\\"Our Song\\\" and \\\"NeuNeu\\\".\\n\\n\\n== Production and equipment ==\\nIn his early years, Mr. Oizo used a Korg MS-20, an Akai S1000, and an Atari 1040 computer. Mr. Oizo is known currently for strong use of computers in his music. As he stated in an interview with XLR8R, he started using computers to avoid having to plug in four different appliances, and because the result of music is more or less the same. His first album to switch to all computers was Moustache (Half a Scissor). In Lambs Anger, Mr. Oizo used a Macintosh G5 running Logic Pro to compose all of the songs. During his DJ sets, he uses two CDJs.\\n\\n\\n== Filmmaking ==\\n\\nDupieux created a number of music videos and feature films, starting with the 1997 music video \\\"Kirk\\\". He not only directs his productions, he is usually also writer, editor, composer and cinematographer.Dupieux's second feature film Steak was released in France on 20 June 2007.Filming for the absurdist horror film Rubber began in 2009. The electronic music duo Justice stated that they would be working on the soundtrack for Rubber, saying they had to 'finish working on the soundtrack for Mr. Oizo's new film before we start recording for the new album'. However, only Gaspard Auge of the duo collaborated with Dupieux on the soundtrack. The film had a United States Video on Demand release.\\nThe surreal comedy Wrong premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in 2012.The comedy Wrong Cops was produced by Realitism Films, who describe it as \\\"a filthy 90 minute comedy about some disturbed cops. It is not a sequel to Wrong.\\\" The first thirteen-minute chapter of the film premiered at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival.\\nDupieux returned in 2014 with the surreal comedy Reality, distributed in the US by IFC Midnight.\\n\\n\\n== Discography ==\\n\\nStudio albums\\n\\nAnalog Worms Attack (1999)\\nMoustache (Half a Scissor) (2005)\\nLambs Anger (2008)\\nStade 2 (2011)\\nThe Church (2014)\\nAll Wet (2016)\\n\\n\\n== Filmography ==\\n\\n\\n=== Music videos ===\\n\\\"Kirk\\\" (1997)\\n\\\"M-Seq\\\" (1999)\\n\\\"Flat Beat\\\" (1999)\\n\\\"Analog Worms Attack\\\" (1999)\\n\\\"Inside The Kidney Machine\\\" (1999)\\n\\\"Stunt\\\" (2004)\\n\\\"Making Lambs Anger\\\" (2009)\\n\\\"Where's the money, George?\\\" (2010)\\n\\\"Being Flat\\\" (2015) (Short film)\\n\\\"Night Owl\\\" - Metronomy (2016)\\n\\n\\n=== Films ===\\nNonfilm (2002) (TV premiere 2007, DVD release 2011; two versions exist, 44 and 75 minutes long, respectively)\\nSteak (2007)\\nRubber (2010)\\nWrong (2012)\\nWrong Cops: Chapter One (2012) (Short film)\\nWrong Cops (2013)\\nReality (2014)\\nAu poste !

The duo first met in 2007, after AK's friend brought Issa to his house one day to smoke marijuana, where they clicked instantly and discussed psychedelic drugs, which they would later do together along with fellow Brooklyn rappers Meechy Darko and Zombie Juice, both of the Flatbush Zombies.\\n\\n\\n=== 2011-2012: Career beginnings, signing to Brainfeeder ===\\nAK began rapping at the age of eleven, later on in high school he would work under the stage name The Underachiever. Issa Gold started rapping much later, not taking it seriously until around late 2011. The duo then began making music together under the name \\\"The Underachievers\\\" after a producer pushed them to work together, which resulted in them forming the group. Issa explained the name saying, \\\"I feel like the things that we do could be considered underachieving, like we smoke pot. People would probably meet us at first and be like, They're probably just potheads. And then they'll talk to me, or talk to AK, and be like, 'alright, they're intelligent.' So it's just a flip on that. Like, The Underachievers, even though technically we're doing underachiever things, we're bringing positive energy.\\\"In May 2012, they released their first music video for the song \\\"So Devilish\\\". Following the videos release they began gaining attention quickly, with their second officially released song \\\"Gold Soul Theory\\\" getting played on BBC Radio in August 2012, even though they had yet to sign a recording contract. Their music was also passed on to record producer Flying Lotus, who the following day flew them out to Los Angeles to meet them the day after they talked for the first time. After they met a few times and performed a few shows for him, he signed them to his Brainfeeder record label. Flying Lotus said he already wanted to sign the duo after listening to one song for only 20 seconds. Around the same time they signed they released their third music video for \\\"Herb Shuttles\\\", which has gotten over seventeen million views on YouTube.

Issa Gold explained the mixtape saying, \\\"This tape is mostly bangers. All the lyrical conscious expanding knowledge filled magical triple optic shit will have to wait for the upcoming album.\\\" Lords of Flatbush was also met with positive critical reception. Stereogum named Lords of Flatbush their mixtape of the week the week of its release. XXL gave the mixtape a 4 out of 5 saying, \\\"This project from The Underachievers may not be as deep and reflective as Indigoism, but it has its high points and serves as a step forward with the group. With a captivating performance in the final half of the tape, the Lords of Flatbush will surely have fans on the edge of their seat for their upcoming album.\\\" On September 14, 2013, they released the music video for \\\"N.A.S.A.\\\"\\n\\n\\n=== 2013-present: Cellar Door: Terminus Ut Exordium, Evermore: The Art of Duality and Renaissance ===\\nFrom October 17, through November 30, 2013, The Underachievers toured with Joey Badass, Pro Era, Ab-Soul, and Chevy Woods, among others on the fourth annual \\\"The Smokers Club Tour\\\".

Ellison kept this fact a secret for several months, finally revealing his identity several weeks after the release of his first rap mixtape, Duality.\\n\\n\\n== Early life and education ==\\nFlying Lotus was born Steven Ellison on October 7, 1983, in Los Angeles, California. He is the grand-nephew of the late jazz pianist Alice Coltrane,  whose husband was saxophonist John Coltrane.  Additionally, he is the grandson of singer-songwriter Marilyn McLeod, who is notable for having written Diana Ross's \\\"Love Hangover\\\" and Freda Payne's \\\"I Get High (On Your Memory)\\\", and is Alice Coltrane's sister. McLeod has been called by one writer \\\"the biggest influence on Ellison's music\\\". A DNA test revealed that Ellison descended from the Tikar people of Cameroon.Ellison attended Los Angeles Film School and Academy of Art University.\\n\\n\\n== Musical career ==\\n\\n\\n=== 2006-07: Adult Swim, 1983 and Warp Records ===\\nAt his mother's house, Ellison saw an advertisement on Adult Swim/Cartoon Network asking for song submissions. He sent some in, under the name Flying Lotus (a moniker inspired by lucid dreaming) and was accepted.Around this time, he was interning at the pioneering hip hop label Stones Throw Records. Days were spent in their offices, and nights were spent at his grandmothers, working on the music that would become his debut album: 1983. The record (released on LA indie label Plug Research) was an early touchstone for Ellison's eclectic creative mission, forging compressed, spacey and Eastern sounding hip-hop beats, that summoned Madlib as much as Dntel, while sampling as far back as 70s Japanese proto-synthpop and 60s jazz harp. It would also feature Laura Darlington, who went on to become a vocal fixture of future albums.In 2006, Ellison participated in that year's annual Red Bull Music Academy, which took place in Melbourne, Australia. In 2007, he announced on CSU-Fullerton's Titan Radio that he signed with Warp Records (home to Prefuse 73, Autechre, Boards of Canada, and Aphex Twin). Following his Warp debut, the six-track Reset EP, he quickly became one of the label's cornerstone artists and released his second studio album, titled Los Angeles, on June 10, 2008.\\nHis first release on Warp, Reset EP, gave his new audience a taste of the steady grooves and darker breaks that had earned him the move. As Ellison's profile rose, he decided to commandeer the limelight by launching his own label, Brainfeeder, to house his friends (Samiyam, Ras G, etc.) and unite a large section of the LA beat scene under one label.\\n\\n\\n=== 2008-09: Los Angeles and Brainfeeder ===\\nIn 2008 Flying Lotus released Los Angeles, a 17-track album dedicated to his home city. The album captured the abundant styles of his city in seventeen bullet sized tracks, that harked back to golden era hip hop while innovating in its endeavours to introduce recalibrated shards of bass, techno and soul, plus samples of his own Aunt's harp playing. Telling Quietus on the subject of J Dillas influence on his music: \\\"I love Dilla and who knows where this beat thing would be without him. His work ethic inspired so many producers around the world, but when he moved out to LA, it seemed that his presence here inspired everyone to kick things into overdrive. If I had to describe his music, I'd say it were 'imaginative soul music'. I think it's his imagination that appeals to me, personally. Dilla could flip a boring record and make you feel like you were flying.\\\"\\n2008 saw Ellison enter a stage of hyper-productivity, as he followed up the Los Angeles record with collaborative tracks with Samiyam and Gonjasufi, a limited white label run of remixes (\\\"Camel\\\", \\\"Lightworks\\\", R2-D2 sound effects, \\\"Shadows of Tomorrow\\\" and \\\"Promiscuous\\\") called Shhh!, and a series of LA inspired EPs. Each of the La EPs features remixes and unreleased tracks from his Los Angeles Album. The third in that series (titled L.A. EP 3 X 3), marked a new atmospheric style in his sound.\\nThe same year, Flying Lotus also remixed \\\"Reckoner\\\" from Radiohead's album In Rainbows.\\n\\n\\n=== 2010-11: Cosmogramma and collaborations ===\\nHis third studio album, Cosmogramma, was released in the UK on May 3, 2010, and in the US on May 4, 2010. In January 2011, Cosmogramma won in the Dance/Electronica Album category in the 10th Annual Independent Music Awards. The multi-award-winning Cosmogramma was a hard-hitting afrofuturistic shrine to soul, hip-hop, jazz and IDM but, with more emphasis on a lyrical message than ever before, it was also a cathartic grieving experience. The album was accompanied by live instrumentation (Thundercat on bass, Miguel Atwood Ferguson on strings, Rebekah Raff on harp) and live vocalists (Thom Yorke, Laura Darlington) - all picked to help communicate the spiritual musical lineage of Ellison's family (Ravi Coltrane, himself, played tenor sax). Stephen Bruner, aka Thundercat, who is featured extensively on Cosmogramma, would later become a large part of future albums by Flying Lotus.\\nIn 2010, Flying Lotus collaborated with the Ann Arbor Film Festival in the performance of a live scoring of the 1962 avant-garde film Heaven and Earth Magic. In a post-viewing interview with the audience, Flying Lotus said that he was unsure whether or not a recording of the performance (or a recreation of it) would be publicly released, but he would be enthusiastic toward similar projects in the future. He was chosen by Battles to perform at the ATP Nightmare Before Christmas festival that it co-curated in December 2011 in Minehead, England, UK.In September 2010, Flying Lotus released \\\"Pattern+Grid World\\\", an 8 track EP featuring Thundercat on bass & art by Theo Ellsworth. The Track Camera Day was used in the Killer Mike song Swimming, which was released as part of the Adult Swim Singles Series.\\nIn January 2011, Flying Lotus won the 10th Annual Independent Music Awards for his video \\\"MmmHmm\\\" in the Short-Form Video category.It was reported in 2011 that Flying Lotus would be collaborating with R&B singer Erykah Badu on new material for her next album, and planned to remix one of Radiohead's songs from The King of Limbs.\\n\\n\\n=== 2012-13: Until the Quiet Comes and Captain Murphy ===\\n\\nWith a lifelong fascination for hip hop, but no firm position within it, the likes of Odd Future (also aficionados of Adult Swim), A$AP Mob, Spaceghostpurrp and Shabazz Palaces inspired him to get a bit more direct, and soon he was knocking out production for Odd Future's Hodgy Beats' Untitled EP. While with Hodgy, he had a moment of rap enlightenment: \\\"I can recall the moment specifically. I haven't told anybody this and I am so glad to talk to you about it. I feel like it was such a big deal for me personally. [Odd Future] started playing me some of The OF Tape Vol. 2. I asked them, 'Yo, Hodgy, how long did it take you to record this shit? How long did it take you to write this song?' 'Aw, my nigga, it took me like 15 minutes.' 15 minutes? Are you fucking serious? I was like, 'Nah, nigga. I am gonna do this shit.'\\\" Throughout the summer of 2012, Captain Murphy would make golden-caped appearances, dressed in Luchadore Ensemble, with his true identity masked to the public.\\nIn August 2012, Flying Lotus announced a multimedia project with filmmaker Miwa Matreyek, which is to be titled The Mapping of Countries Yet to Come.Flying Lotus produced rapper Mac Miller's song \\\"SDS'\\\" for his album Watching Movies with the Sound Off. He also created a song for the Cartoon Network series Adventure Time entitled \\\"About that time//A glitch is a glitch\\\".Behind closed doors though, the work for his fourth album Until the Quiet Comes was pretty much done. A year prior, Ellison had worked with Ann Arbor Festival to live score a surreal and avant-garde 50s animation Heaven and Earth Magic (pictured below), and a fascination with dreamlike states had continued into this record. Until The Quiet Comes continued his creative relationship with Radiohead's Thom Yorke, as well as Jonny Greenwood, Niki Randa, Erykah Badu, Laura Darlington and, of course, Thundercat, and was cinematically captured in a short film by Kahlil Joseph.\\nIn late 2012, less than two months after the release of his last record, a website started circulating online: www.captainmurphy.xxx. Press speculated who the rapper was, with guessing being centered around the Odd Future Crew. The site hosted Duality, a 34-minute short film mixtape, that comprised both new material and tracks that had been leaking all summer.\\nIn April 2013, Flying Lotus announced that he has his own radio station called FlyLo FM in the video game Grand Theft Auto V, saying there would be \\\"a ton of new songs and information, including rapping a new Captain Murphy song produced by Hudson Mohawke\\\".On July 17, 2013, Flying Lotus announced on Twitter that he had been nominated for a VMA for the song \\\"Tiny Tortures\\\".\\n\\n\\n=== 2014-2015: You're Dead! ===\\nOn July 15, 2014, Flying Lotus posted on Instagram a photo of vinyl test pressings labeled \\\"LP #5\\\". On July 22, he announced that his fifth studio album, You're Dead!, would be released in the UK on October 6, 2014, and in the US on October 7, 2014. The album features guest appearances by Kendrick Lamar, Snoop Dogg and Herbie Hancock.\\nOn August 15, 2014, Flying Lotus released a new song called \\\"Cosplay\\\" with his alias Captain Murphy.On September 30, 2014, Flying Lotus scored the short film A Portrait of Noomi Rapace, starring actress Noomi Rapace and directed by Aitor Throup.During the summer of 2015, Flying Lotus appeared at many summer music festivals including the Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival, the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, the Governors Ball Music Festival and the Glastonbury Festival. His performances received critical acclaim, with many guest appearances from artists such as Thundercat, Kendrick Lamar and George Clinton.\\nHe appeared alongside Thundercat on Kendrick Lamar's album To Pimp a Butterfly. In July 2015, Flying Lotus, made his national television debut on Why? with Hannibal Buress, as the show's in-studio disc jockey.Lotus received two Grammy Award nominations at the 58th ceremony: Best Dance Recording for his song \\\"Never Catch Me\\\" and Album of the Year for his credits as producer on Kendrick Lamar's To Pimp a Butterfly.\\n\\n\\n=== 2016-present: Kuso ===\\nOn July 5, 2016, Ellison announced the start of Brainfeeder film division. Shortly after, at the Sundance NEXT festival, he premiered a short film titled Royal. It was later revealed to be part of his feature film directorial debut, Kuso. Kuso would star Hannibal Buress, Tim Heidecker and David Firth among others. Kuso featured new music from Ellison himself under both the Flying Lotus and Captain Murphy names, Aphex Twin, Busdriver, and Thundercat, among others. Kuso premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in 2017. On June 6, 2017, Ellison announced that Kuso would be released via the horror video streaming service Shudder, on July 21, 2017. Kuso was also confirmed a theatrical release in New York City and Los Angeles. Addressing the responsibility of the wide release of Kuso, on Twitter, Ellison praised Shudder, explaining he found it to be a suitable home for the film's release.On November 2, 2017, Ellison released a music video for a new song of his, \\\"Post Requisite\\\", and is \\\"currently finishing his next studio album on Warp\\\". He also wrote the soundtrack for the 2017 short film Blade Runner Black Out 2022.\\n\\n\\n== Influences and style ==\\nFlying Lotus has stated that he is influenced by Madlib, Herbie Hancock, MF DOOM, his great aunt Alice Coltrane, his great uncle John Coltrane, Miles Davis, and J Dilla.

In 2016, Thundercat won a Grammy for Best Rap/Sung Performance for his work on the track \\\"These Walls\\\" from To Pimp a Butterfly.\\n\\n\\n== Music career ==\\nBorn into a family of musicians, Bruner began playing the bass at an early age: by 15 he had a minor hit in Germany as a member of the boy band No Curfew. A year later he joined his brother Ronald Jr. as a member of the Los Angeles punk band Suicidal Tendencies, replacing former bass player Josh Paul.\\nAlong with his band duties Bruner is also a session musician, acclaimed for his work on Erykah Badu's New Amerykah (2008) and Flying Lotus' Cosmogramma (2010). He released his first solo album in 2011, The Golden Age of Apocalypse, which featured production from Flying Lotus, and was influenced by 1970s fusion artists such as Stanley Clarke and George Duke. The next two years saw a return to the recording studio with fellow Brainfeeder artist Flying Lotus, with contributions to the Lotus's Until the Quiet Comes (2012) and You're Dead! (2014), and the release of Thundercat's second album Apocalypse (2013).\\n\\n\\n=== To Pimp a Butterfly ===\\nBruner has been described as being a major contributor to and \\\"at the creative epicenter\\\" of Kendrick Lamar's critically acclaimed album To Pimp a Butterfly.Along with the involvements with previous artists, Thundercat draws inspiration from jazz musicians such as Miles Davis, Mary Lou Williams and Ron Carter. Through this, he is frequently able to renew elements from old soul, funk, and jazz albums. Known as \\\"digging in the crates\\\", this method is best used to bring the sound, feel and emotion he wants to convey in his music. An example of this can be heard on his EP released in 2015 titled The Beyond / Where the Giants Roam. The most popular track on this EP titled Them Changes, also shares this creative renewal element. Them Changes contains a drum sample from the 1977 track \\\"Footsteps in the Dark\\\" by the Isley Brothers.\\nIn 2016, Bruner revealed to XXL that he is working on a new album with Flying Lotus as a main contributor. In May of that year, Bruner appeared live with Red Hot Chili Peppers to play additional bass on their song \\\"Go Robot\\\" at iHeartRadio's release party for the band's 2016 album The Getaway. In August 2016, Bruner appeared live with singers Kenny Loggins and Michael McDonald in Chicago.\\n\\n\\n=== Drunk ===\\nIn June 2017, Thundercat appeared on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon to promote his studio album Drunk with Michael McDonald and Kenny Loggins.\\n\\n\\n== Discography ==\\n\\n\\n=== Studio albums ===\\n\\n\\n=== EPs ===\\nThe Beyond / Where the Giants Roam (2015)\\n\\n\\n=== With Kendrick Lamar ===\\nTo Pimp a Butterfly (2015)\\nUntitled Unmastered (2016)\\nDamn (2017)\\n\\n\\n=== With Kamasi Washington ===\\nLive at 5th Street Dick's (2005)\\nThe Epic (2015)\\nHarmony of Difference (2017)\\nHeaven and Earth (2018)\\n\\n\\n=== With Flying Lotus ===\\nCosmogramma  (2010)\\nPattern+Grid World (2010)\\nUntil the Quiet Comes (2012)\\nIdeas+drafts+loops (2013)\\nYou're Dead!

They also have music-themed group art shows such as Into Infinity, Dream Scene, Up Our Sleeve, and Patchwork.\\ndublab was founded in 1999 by Jonathan Buck, Mark McNeill and fellow students from KSCR Radio at the University of Southern California.\\n\\n\\n== Resident DJs ==\\n\\n\\n== Notable Guests, Artists and DJs ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nDublab official site\\naudio stream\\nInto Infinity online exhibition\\nUp Our Sleeve - Covers Art Project\\nTurning On Tomorrow: Dublab's Proton Drive Fundraiser\\nDUBLAB'S SECONDHAND SURESHOTS: DVD, 12-INCH, SLIPMATS & HAND-SCREENED SLEEVES\\ncore programs: futureroots.org\", \"rev_id\": 855140736, \"accessed\": \"2018-09-03 00:23:59.864295\", \"links\": [\"Barnsdall Art Park\", \"Underwriting spots\", \"Podcast\", \"KSCR (USC AM radio station)\", \"Disney Hall\", \"LACMA\", \"El Rey Theatre\", \"Creative Commons\", \"Hammer Museum\", \"University of Southern California\", \"Hollywood Bowl\", \"Los Angeles\", \"UCLA\", \"RSS\", \"Daedelus\", \"Shoutcast\", \"Art Center College of Design\", \"CalArts\"]}, {\"title\": \"Alpha Pup Records\", \"link_id\": \"Alpha Pup Records\", \"summary\": \"Alpha Pup Records is an independent record label and digital distributor based in Los Angeles, California.

Discogs currently contains over 10 million releases, by over 5 million artists, across over 1 million labels, contributed from over 400,000 contributor user accounts -- with these figures constantly growing as users continually add previously unlisted releases to the site over time.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nThe discogs.com domain name was registered on 30 August 2000, and Discogs itself was launched in November 2000 by programmer, DJ, and music fan Kevin Lewandowski originally as a database of electronic music.He was inspired by the success of community-built sites such as Slashdot, eBay, and Open Directory Project, and decided to use this model for a music discography database.The site's original goal was to build the most comprehensive database of electronic music, organized around the artists, labels, and releases available in that genre. In 2003 the Discogs system was completely rewritten, and in January 2004 it began to support other genres, starting with hip hop. Since then, it has expanded to include rock and jazz in January 2005 and funk/soul, Latin, and reggae in October of the same year. In January 2006 blues and non-music (e.g. comedy records, field recordings, interviews) were added. Classical music started being supported in June 2007, and in October 2007 the \\\"final genres were turned on\\\" - adding support for the Stage & Screen, Brass & Military, Children's, and Folk, World, & Country music genres, allowing capture of virtually every single type of audio recording that has ever been released.\\nOn 30 June 2004, Discogs published a report, which included information about the number of its contributors. This report claimed that Discogs had 15,788 contributors and 260,789 releases.On 20 July 2007 a new system for sellers was introduced on the site called Market Price History. It made information available to users who paid for a subscription - though 60 days information was free - access to the past price items were sold for up to 12 months ago by previous sellers who had sold exactly the same release. At the same time, the US$12 per year charge for advanced subscriptions was abolished, as it was felt that the extra features should be made available to all subscribers now that a better, some may say fairer, revenue stream had been found from sellers and purchasers. However, at the beginning of 2008, the Market Price History was also made free of charge for all users, still giving up to a 12-month view of historical sales data for any release.\\n\\n\\n== Milestones ==\\nDiscogs publishes information indicating the number of releases, labels, and artists presently in its database, along with its contributors:\\n\\n\\n== Other projects ==\\nDiscogs has so far created a further six online databases, for collating information on related topics.\\n\\n\\n=== VinylHub ===\\nIn mid 2014, a side project website called VinylHub was started, in order for users to add record shops and stores from around the world, with information concerning location, contact details, what type of items they stocked, et al.\\n\\n\\n=== Filmogs ===\\nIn late 2014, the company released a new beta website called Filmogs. Users can add their physical film collections (on DVD, Blu-ray, LaserDisc, or any other type of physical film release) to the database, and buy and sell film releases in the global marketplace.\\n\\n\\n=== Gearogs ===\\nGearogs was launched as a beta in late 2014, at the same time as Filmogs. The site lets users add and track music equipment, including items such as synths, drum machines, sequencers, samplers, audio software, and any other electronic music making equipment.\\n\\n\\n=== Bookogs ===\\nAt the start of 2015, the company began Bibliogs as another beta project. Users can submit information about their books, physical or electronic, different versions and editions, and also connect different credits (writers, illustrators, translators, publishers, etc.) to these books. 21,000 books were submitted by the end of 2016. The project was in beta phase until 15 August 2017 when it reached more than 31,000 book titles, and rebranded without clear explanation to Bookogs.com, obviously because of legal issues with the old name Bibliogs, and removed 'Beta state' notice from the main page. The next day the 'Marketplace Beta' feature was presented.\\n\\n\\n=== Comicogs ===\\nComicogs launched around the same time as Bookogs, as a means for comic collectors and enthusiasts to catalog their collections and create an archive of comic releases. Similar to Bookogs, users can contribute comics, manga, graphic novels, and strips to the database, along with information on credits, publishers, writers, etc. 18,000 comics were submitted by the start of 2018. The Comicogs marketplace was launched on 23 August 2017, allowing users to buy and sell comics from across the world.\\n\\n\\n=== Posterogs ===\\nIn September 2017, the company launched Posterogs. Posterogs was the only Discogs site to launch a database and marketplace simultaneously. The scope of Posterogs was left broad at the time of launch, with the company opting to let the community define what type of posters, flyers, or similar, should be included in the database. As users have contributed items to the database, while non-music related items are fully acceptable for inclusion, much of the primary focus seems to be music posters, such as gig/tour posters, album promo posters, and promotional flyers - which is in keeping with Discogs' music theme, though there are also many film posters in the database. As with all other databases, users can save posters to their 'Collection' and 'Wantlist', in addition to buying and selling in the marketplace.\\n\\n\\n== API ==\\nIn mid-August 2007, Discogs data became publicly accessible via a RESTful, XML-based API and a license that allowed specially attributed use, but did not allow anyone to \\\"alter, transform, or build upon\\\" the data. The license has since been changed to a public domain one. Prior to the advent of this license and API, Discogs data was only accessible via the Discogs web site's HTML interface and was intended to be viewed only using web browsers. The HTML interface remains the only authorized way to modify Discogs data.On 7 June 2011 version 2 of the API was released. Notable in this release was that a license key was no longer required, the default response was changed from XML to JSON, and the 5000 queries per day limit was removed (although a limit of 2000 image lookups per days was introduced).\\nOn 1 November 2011 a major update to version 2 of the API was released. This new release dropped support for XML, data is always returned in JSON format, however the monthly data dumps of new data are only provided in XML format.\\nOn 1 February 2014 Discogs modified their API so that image requests will now require OAuth authorization, requiring each user of third-party applications to have a Discogs \\\"application ID\\\", with image requests now limited to 1,000 per day. Additionally the Premium API service was dropped.On 24 June 2014 Discogs deprecated their XML API in lieu of a JSON-formatted API.Discogs also allows full XML downloads of its Release, Artist, and Label data through the data.discogs.com subdomain.\\nThe recommendations API is not publicly available.\\n\\n\\n== Contribution system ==\\nThe data in Discogs comes from submissions contributed by users who have registered accounts on the web site. The system has gone through four major revisions.\\n\\n\\n=== Version One (V1) ===\\nAll incoming submissions were checked for formal and factual correctness by privileged users called \\\"moderators\\\", or \\\"mods\\\" for short, who had been selected by site management. Submissions and edits wouldn't become visible or searchable until they received a single positive vote from a \\\"mod\\\". An even smaller pool of super-moderators called \\\"editors\\\" had the power to vote on proposed edits to artist & label data.\\n\\n\\n=== Version Two (V2) ===\\nThis version introduced the concept of \\\"submission limits\\\" which prevented new users from submitting more than 2-3 releases for moderation. The number of possible submissions by a user increased on a logarithmic scale. The purpose of this was two-fold: 1) it helped keep the submission queue fairly small and manageable for moderators, and 2) it allowed the new user to acclimatise themselves slowly with the many formatting rules and guidelines of submitting to Discogs. Releases required a number of votes to be accepted into the database - initially the number of votes required was from 4 different moderators but in time the amount was decreased to 3 and then 2.\\n\\n\\n=== Version Three (V3) ===\\nV3 launched in August 2007. Submission limits were eliminated, allowing each user to submit an unlimited number of updates and new entries. New releases added to the database were explicitly marked as \\\"Unmoderated\\\" with a top banner, and updates to existing items, such as releases, artists, or labels, were not shown (or available to search engines or casual visitors) until they were approved by the moderators.\\n\\n\\n=== Version Four (V4) ===\\nThis system launched on 10 March 2008. New submissions and edits currently take effect immediately. Any time a new release is added or old release edited, that entry becomes flagged as needing \\\"votes\\\" (initially, \\\"review,\\\" but this term caused confusion). A flagged entry is marked as a full yellow bar across a release in the list views and, like version three, a banner on the submission itself - although, initially, this banner was omitted.\\nAny item can be voted on at any time, even if it isn't flagged. Votes consist of a rating of the correctness & completeness of the full set of data for an item (not just the most recent changes), as assessed by users who have been automatically determined, by an undisclosed algorithm, to be experienced & reliable enough to be allowed to cast votes. An item's \\\"average\\\" vote is displayed with the item's data.The ranking system has also changed in v4. In v3, rank points were only awarded to submitters when a submission was \\\"Accepted\\\" by moderator votes. While in v4, rank points are now awarded immediately when a submission is made, regardless of the accuracy of the information and what votes it eventually receives, if any.\\n\\n\\n== Discogs-aware metadata software ==\\n\\n\\n=== Tag editors ===\\n\\nASMT MP3 Tagger - single release tagger\\nfoobar2000 - freeware media player and music management software with a plugin\\nHelium Music Manager - music management software with a plugin\\nJaikoz - shareware OS X/Windows/Linux spreadsheet-based tag editor\\nKid3 - open-source project, tagger for all common music formats\\nMp3tag - freeware tag editor, batch and spreadsheet interfaces\\nOrangeCD Catalog - music management software\\npuddletag - a free and open-source tag editor written for PyQt\\ntaghycardia - freeware, automated MP3 tagger\\nTagog - Linux audio file tagger\\nTagScanner - freeware tag editor with Discogs, FreeDB, TrackType.org support\\nThe GodFather - freeware tag editor\\nThe Tagger - MP3 and AAC formats tag editor for OS X\\nTigoTago - spreadsheet-based tag editor\\n\\n\\n=== Other ===\\nMP3 Filenamer - online MP3 file name generator, based on Discogs release data\\nDiscogs Bar - Discogs navigation and search control toolbar for Firefox\\nAlbum Art Downloader - Discogs cover art downloads\\nWWW::Discogs - Perl module for interfacing with the Discogs API\\nXLD (X Lossless Decoder) - a CD ripper and audio file converter for OS X\\nMusic Collector - Music database software by collectorz.com\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nList of online music databases\\nGlobal Electronic Music Marketplace\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nDiscogs - official site\\nDiscogs wiki\", \"rev_id\": 854314699, \"accessed\": \"2018-09-03 00:12:00.995981\", \"links\": [\"Slashdot\", \"List of online music databases\", \"Jaikoz\", \"PyQt\", \"Linux\", \"HTML\", \"Kid3\", \"Portland, Oregon\", \"JSON\", \"Global Electronic Music Marketplace\", \"OS X\", \"Tag editor\", \"MP3\", \"XML\", \"OAuth\", \"Firefox\", \"Mp3tag\", \"Open Directory Project\"]}]"
