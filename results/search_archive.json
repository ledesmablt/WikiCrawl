Later members include Earl Sweatshirt, Frank Ocean, Domo Genesis, Mike G, and Syd. Outside music, Odd Future had an Adult Swim skit show called Loiter Squad and a clothing line named OFWGKTA.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\n\\n=== 2007-2010: Founding and rise in popularity ===\\nOdd Future was formed in 2007 in Los Angeles. The original members were founder Tyler, the Creator (Tyler Okonma), Left Brain (Vyron Turner), Hodgy Beats (Gerard Long) and Jasper Dolphin (Davon Wilson). At some point before the release of Bastard, Chicago-based rapper brandUn DeShay collaborated with the group, and appeared on the track \\\"Session,\\\" but Tyler and DeShay had a falling out, and his vocals on \\\"Session\\\" were replaced by Mike G. Much of their early music was recorded in a room of Syd tha Kyd and Taco's South Central Los Angeles home, known as the Trap.\\nDomo Genesis, Earl Sweatshirt, Mike G, and Frank Ocean joined the group between 2009 and 2010.. The group completed a two-stop tour, their first outside Los Angeles: in London, England, on November 5, 2010, and New York City on November 8. The concert at The Drop in London sold out within 48 hours of announcement by the group. Their concerts have been compared to punk rock shows, with stagediving, moshing, and group members antagonizing the crowd.\\n\\n\\n=== 2011-15: Solo releases and Loiter Squad ===\\n\\nMellowHype re-released their album BlackenedWhite through Fat Possum Records. Frank Ocean self-released his debut mixtape, Nostalgia, Ultra on February 16, 2011 after joining Odd Future. Tyler, the Creator also signed a one-album deal with XL Recordings and released his sophomore effort, Goblin, on May 10, 2011. They have collected a cult following, and have received press attention from blogs and magazines. Though they are often labeled as horrorcore, the group has universally dismissed it on Twitter, in interviews, and on tracks such as \\\"Sandwitches\\\". Pitchfork Media has labeled the group as indie rap. In April 2011, the group signed a deal with RED Distribution and Sony Music Entertainment to start their own label, Odd Future Records. On August 2, 2011, Odd Future announced on their website the Golf Wang Tour 2011. The tour included 27 stops, beginning on September 28, 2011 in San Diego, California at the House of Blues.On September 8, 2011, it was announced that Odd Future would be making a television show called Loiter Squad. The show was announced to be a sketch comedy show featuring various skits and pranks and originally aired on March 25, 2012 on Adult Swim. The show features Tyler, Jasper, Taco, Earl and Lionel as main cast members with other members of Odd Future making cameo appearances. The program is produced by Dickhouse Productions, which also is the production company for Jackass.\\nOn October 3, 2011, Tyler, The Creator tweeted a link to iTunes with a compilation album of 12 old Odd Future songs from artists within the group such as Domo Genesis, Hodgy Beats, Mike G, The Jet Age of Tomorrow, MellowHype, The Internet, and Tyler himself. The album is simply named 12 Odd Future Songs, despite having 13 tracks, including a brand new release by The Internet. On March 20, 2012, the collective released their debut album, The OF Tape Vol. 2. The album was a sequel to the original mixtape, The Odd Future Tape. On the same day, Earl Sweatshirt, who was absent from Odd Future from June 2010 until February 2012, first performed with the group at the Hammerstein Ballroom in New York.Frank Ocean released his debut studio album channel ORANGE on July 17, 2012. Other solo releases for the second half of 2012 included Domo Genesis's No Idols with The Alchemist, released on August 1, and MellowHype's Numbers, released on October 9. On December 5, 2012 it was announced Frank Ocean was nominated for six awards at the 55th Grammys, including Best New Artist, Record of the Year for \\\"Thinkin Bout You\\\" and Album of the Year for channel ORANGE.\\nOn April 2, Tyler, The Creator released his second studio album, Wolf, which received positive reviews from critics and debuted at #3 on the Billboard 200, selling 89,895 copies in the United States. Earl Sweatshirt released his debut studio album Doris on August 20, 2013, which was met with critical acclaim, and MellowHigh released their self-titled debut album together on October 31, 2013.\\n\\nOn September 12, the Odd Future station premiered on the online 24/7 radio, Dash Radio, which was released the month before by DJ Skee. The station features a live playlist, special links such as \\\"Taco Tuesday\\\" (also repeated on Fridays) and coverage of live events, such as the Camp Flog Gnaw Carnival, also hosted by Odd Future.\\n\\n\\n=== 2015-present: Inactivity as a collective ===\\nOn January 18, 2015, Hodgy Beats confirmed that MellowHype will no longer exist, and that he and Left Brain will continue to make music together, just no longer under the name MellowHype. Hodgy states in the interview, \\\"Nah, we ain't breaking up. Nah, this ain't no weirdo shit. It's just some real shit. It's a refocus. Going from boys to men this is what it is. So it's either understand it, 'cause it will be explained-cry about it, talk shit, applaud us-we still moving.\\\" In May 2015, Tyler posted a photo on Twitter from 2010 which contained the entire Odd Future collective. He added \\\"although it's no more, those 7 letters [OFWGKTA] are forever.\\\" This was widely believed to be a confirmation of the collective's dissolution. However, the next day he explained that his tweet was misinterpreted and was merely \\\"looking at old photos with friends and thinking about how time flies.\\\" The next day, member Earl Sweatshirt wrote: \\\"No sympathy for male virgins who're in their feelings about Tyler pointing out and solidifying the obvious.\\\" This caused an Internet debate over whether \\\"the obvious\\\" was referring to Tyler's first statement or his second. On June 30, Matt Martians seemingly confirmed to AllHipHop that Odd Future had indeed broken up, but that there were \\\"no hard feelings among the members of OFWGKTA.\\\"\\\"OFWGKTA\\\" was listed on the bill for Tyler, the Creator's 4th Annual Camp Flog Gnaw Carnival. The line-up that performed included Hodgy Beats, Domo Genesis, Mike G and Left Brain. Tyler and Earl were not a part of the set due to Tyler already having a solo show and Earl having amicably distanced himself from Odd Future around the release of his second album I Don't Like Shit, I Don't Go Outside.\\nDuring the Odd Future set at the 4th Annual Camp Flog Gnaw Carnival, Hodgy Beats called out Tyler, The Creator onstage about his dissatisfaction with Tyler, and remarking how he \\\"stayed broke\\\", and was also visibly irritated when other Odd Future members thanked Tyler for the invite to the carnival. Tyler responded to Hodgy in the middle of his solo set, saying \\\"Niggas got me fucked up. I put too many niggas on. I helped too many of my motherfucking friends out, and niggas gonna come foul? You know who the fuck I'm talking about, nigga. And yes, this is real.\\\" Hodgy responded to these remarks on Twitter by saying \\\"If it wasn't for Odd Future, where would Tyler be?\\\" and \\\"Think about who built the name OF together as a unit. Now think about who took the first initial shit on OF.\\\" However, one day later, a humorous Instagram video, uploaded by Hodgy, featured him and Tyler attempting to perform handstands; possibly suggesting that the feud had been dissolved. The video was later removed.On March 11, 2016, Syd Tha Kyd officially announced her departure from Odd Future, making The Internet only a label associated act. She also stated that she has not thought of herself as a member of Odd Future as a rap group since early 2011 when The Internet formed.On May 2, 2016, the group confirmed that they are still together on their Twitter.Some rumors began to circulate in August-September 2016 about the group working together musically again after a picture was taken of Tyler, The Creator, Earl Sweatshirt, Syd Tha Kyd, Jasper Dolphin, Taco Bennett, and Matt Martians together at the Afropunk Festival. Tyler and Earl performed as EarlWolf again for the first time in years.On February 6, 2017, MellowHype confirmed they are working together once again on MindGone Vol. 1.\\n\\n\\n== Members ==\\n\\n\\n=== Current members ===\\nTyler, the Creator - rapper, producer, music video director (2007-present)\\nHodgy - rapper, producer (2007-present)\\nLeft Brain - producer, DJ, rapper (2007-present)\\nPyramid Vritra - producer, rapper (2007-present)\\nFrank Ocean - singer, producer, rapper (2010-present)\\nJasper Dolphin - rapper, hypeman (2007-present)\\nEarl Sweatshirt - rapper, producer, DJ (2009-present)\\nDomo Genesis - rapper, DJ (2009-present)\\nMatt Martians - producer, singer (2007-present)\\nMike G - rapper, DJ (2009-present)\\nTaco - DJ, rapper (2009-present)\\nL-Boy - hypeman (2011-present)\\nNa'kel - rapper, hypeman (2012-present)\\nLucas Vercetti - hypeman (2009-present)\\n\\n\\n=== Former members ===\\nCasey Veggies - rapper (2007-2009)\\nbrandUn DeShay - rapper, producer (2008-2010)\\nSyd - singer, DJ, producer (2008-2016)\\n\\n\\n== Sub-groups ==\\n\\n\\n=== Current groups ===\\nThe Internet (2011-present) Syd tha Kyd\\nMatt Martians\\nPatrick Paige II\\nChristopher Smith\\nSteve Lacy\\nThe Jet Age of Tomorrow (2008-2013, 2017-present)\\nMatt Martians\\nPyramid Vritra\\nMellowHype (2008-2015, 2017-present)\\nHodgy\\nLeft Brain\\nEarlWolf (2010-present)\\nTyler, the Creator\\nEarl Sweatshirt\\nMellowHigh (2011-present)\\nHodgy\\nLeft Brain\\nDomo Genesis\\nHog Slaughta Boyz (2015-present)\\nEarl Sweatshirt\\nNa'kel\\n\\n\\n=== Former groups ===\\nI Smell Panties (2008)\\nTyler, the Creator\\nJasper Dolphin\\nThe Super D3Shay (2008-2010)\\nMatt Martians\\nPyramid Vritra\\nbrandUn DeShay\\nSweaty Martians (2012-2014)\\nEarl Sweatshirt\\nMatt Martians\\n\\n\\n== Ban on performing ==\\nOdd Future were scheduled to appear at the February, 2014 Rapture Festival in Auckland, New Zealand, as a supporting act to Eminem. The group were not on the original bill, but were substituting for Kendrick Lamar after the concert had been sold out. A campaign was launched by an anti-violence group to prevent Odd Future performing, based partly on prior occurrences of the group supposedly inciting violence by their fans towards members of the public, and by the group's lyrics allegedly supporting rape and violence towards women. Immigration New Zealand canceled the visa of some group members because of prior acts of inciting violence, including one where the group allegedly encouraged fans to attack members of the police.As of 2015, Tyler, The Creator has been banned from the United Kingdom for 3-5 years due to the allegedly homophobic and violent content of his lyrics from earlier albums such as Bastard and Goblin.\\n\\n\\n== Discography ==\\n\\n\\n=== Albums ===\\nThe OF Tape Vol. 2 (2012)\\n\\n\\n=== Mixtapes ===\\nThe Odd Future Tape (2008)\\nRadical (2010)\\n\\n\\n=== Compilations ===\\n12 Odd Future Songs (2011)\\n\\n\\n== Awards and nominations ==\\n\\n\\n== Notes ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nOfficial website\\n Media related to Odd Future Wolf Gang Kill Them All at Wikimedia Commons\", \"accessed\": \"2018-08-07 23:56:59.343042\"}, {\"links\": [\"119 (album)\", \"12 Odd Future Songs\", \"2011 MTV Video Music Awards\", \"435 (song)\", \"55th Annual Grammy Awards\", \"60th Annual Grammy Awards\", \"911 / Mr. Lonely\", \"A$AP Rocky\", \"ASAP Rocky\", \"African American\", \"Agnostic atheism\", \"Ali (mixtape)\", \"Alternative hip hop\", \"Anna of the North\", \"Atheism\", \"Axe Cop (TV series)\", \"BMX bike\", \"Bastard (Tyler, The Creator album)\", \"Bastard (Tyler, the Creator album)\", \"Bastard (Tyler, the Creator mixtape)\", \"Bastard (Tyler, the Creator song)\", \"Bastard (mixtape)\", \"Beats 1\", \"Bibliotheque nationale de France\", \"Biking (Frank Ocean song)\", \"Bill Nye\", \"Bill Nye Saves the World\", \"Billboard (magazine)\", \"Billboard 200\", \"Black Dynamite (TV series)\", \"Black Lips\", \"BlackenedWhite\", \"Blonde (Frank Ocean album)\", \"Blonded Radio\", \"Boyce Watkins\", \"Camp Flog Gnaw Carnival\", \"Campus Progress\", \"Casey Veggies\", \"Channel Orange\", \"Charlie Wilson (singer)\", \"Cherry Bomb (album)\", \"Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival\", \"Columbia Records\", \"Coming out\", \"Cover art\", \"D.A.

He has said that he has never met his father, and spent his early life living in the communities of Ladera Heights and Hawthorne, California. At the age of seven, he would take the cover out of an album's case and create covers for his own imaginary albums--including a track list with song lengths--before he could even make music. At the age of 14, he taught himself to play the piano. In his 12 years of schooling, he attended 12 different schools in the Los Angeles and Sacramento areas. He worked at FedEx for just under two weeks, and Starbucks for over two years. Okonma took his stage name from a MySpace page he used to post his creative endeavors.\\n\\n\\n== Career ==\\n\\n\\n=== 2009-11: Bastard and Goblin ===\\n\\nOn December 25, 2009, Okonma self-released his first mixtape, Bastard. The mixtape was eventually ranked 32nd on Pitchfork Media's list of the Top Albums of 2010. On February 11, 2011, Okonma released the music video for \\\"Yonkers\\\", the first single from his first album, Goblin, which was released May 10, 2011.  The video has received attention from several online media outlets. An extended version with a third verse can be purchased on iTunes.After the release of \\\"Yonkers\\\", Okonma announced that he had signed a one-album deal with XL Recordings. Okonma and fellow Odd Future member Hodgy Beats made their television debut on February 16, 2011 when they performed \\\"Sandwitches\\\" on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon. On March 16, Okonma and Hodgy performed \\\"Yonkers\\\" and \\\"Sandwitches\\\" on the 2011 mtvU Woodie Awards, being joined by other members of Odd Future during \\\"Sandwitches\\\". Goblin was released on May 10, 2011. During an interview with Okonma for Interview, Waka Flocka Flame expressed his interest in collaborating with the Odd Future frontman to direct a music video for him.\\n\\n\\n=== 2012-14: Wolf and Loiter Squad ===\\n\\nOkonma first mentioned the album in early 2010 saying that he would have an album titled Wolf. In early 2011 he told fans through his Formspring account that his third album would be called Wolf and it was scheduled to be released in May 2012. The album continued Okonma's sessions with his fictional therapist, Dr. TC, as hinted by the title track on his mixtape, Bastard, in which Dr. TC says \\\"this is the first of three sessions...\\\" Okonma's second album Wolf, released on April 2, 2013, contains the instrumentals that Okonma has been making since the age of 15. In August 2011, Okonma said that the album will be more focused on beats and have less rapping.\\n\\nDuring the time fans have been in waiting for Wolf, Okonma performed several guest verses for other artists, notably \\\"Trouble on My Mind\\\" by GOOD Music artist Pusha T, \\\"Martians vs. Goblins by Game (also featuring Lil Wayne), \\\"I'ma Hata\\\" by DJ Drama (also featuring Waka Flocka Flame and D-Bo), the title track from fellow Odd Future member Domo Genesis' collaboration album with The Alchemist, No Idols, and \\\"Blossom & Burn\\\" by Trash Talk (also featuring Hodgy Beats). Okonma also co-produced the song \\\"666\\\" from MellowHype's third album Numbers, which featured Mike G. Okonma won Best New Artist for \\\"Yonkers\\\" at the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards. In an interview with DJ Semtex, he confirmed that he will handle all the production on his upcoming album, except one song produced by Left Brain. This was how the production on Goblin was dealt with.\\nOkonma initially announced in early 2011, after Los Angeles hip hop collective Odd Future announced, that they will get their own TV show called Loiter Squad. It wasn't until September 8, 2011 that the show was finally confirmed as a 15-minute live action show composed of various sketches, man on the street segments, pranks and music made by OF. Dickhouse Productions, the production partnership that created Jackass, is scheduled to produce the show. The show premiered on March 25, 2012. Okonma has also directed music videos, acted in two roles, and also done work as a graphic artist.On February 14, 2013, OFWGKTA uploaded a video to their YouTube account, which includes L-Boy skydiving and stating that Wolf would be released on April 2, 2013. The same day Okonma would reveal the three album covers via his Instagram. Through March and April 2013, Okonma toured North America and Europe on the Wolf Tour. The first single from the album was released on February 14, 2013, titled \\\"Domo23\\\" along with the music video which features cameos from Domo Genesis, Earl Sweatshirt, Jasper Dolphin and Taco Bennett. On February 26, 2013, Okonma performed the songs \\\"Domo23\\\" and \\\"Treehome95\\\" on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon.Wolf was released on April 2, 2013 by Odd Future Records and RED Distribution under Sony Music Entertainment. It featured guest appearances by Frank Ocean, Mike G, Domo Genesis, Earl Sweatshirt, Left Brain, Hodgy Beats, Pharrell, Casey Veggies and Erykah Badu. The album was produced solely by Tyler, the Creator, except for the final track \\\"Lone\\\". Along with the lead single \\\"Domo23\\\", music videos were filmed for \\\"Bimmer\\\", \\\"IFHY\\\" and \\\"Jamba\\\". Upon release the album was met with generally positive reviews and debuted at number three on the Billboard 200 selling 90,000 copies in its first week.\\nOn January 31, 2014, Okonma was reported to be recording with Mac DeMarco.\\n\\n\\n=== 2015-16: Cherry Bomb ===\\nOn April 9, 2015, Okonma released a new song entitled \\\"Fucking Young\\\" to the official OFWGKTA YouTube page along with a music video and short preview of another song entitled \\\"Deathcamp\\\". Okonma announced the same day that the songs will be featured on an upcoming album entitled Cherry Bomb due for release on April 13, 2015. Okonma announced via his Twitter account that the album would feature Charlie Wilson, Chaz Bundick and Cole Alexander from Black Lips. Two days later, Okonma performed the songs \\\"Fucking Young\\\" and \\\"Deathcamp\\\" for the first time at Coachella music festival. During the set, Okonma notably criticized VIP members in the audience, of which many were celebrities, for their lack of enthusiasm.Okonma's third album Cherry Bomb was released digitally on April 13, 2015, through Okonma's own label Odd Future Records, with physical copies of the album, featuring five different album covers, set to be released on April 28, 2015. The album features performances from notable artists such as Kanye West, Lil Wayne and Schoolboy Q. The album will be supported with a world tour through North America, Europe and Asia, beginning at Coachella music festival on April 11, 2015 and ending in Tokyo, Japan in September 2015. Okonma cancelled the Australian leg of his Cherry Bomb World Tour following a campaign by the grassroots organization Collective Shout against the portrayal of women in his music.On August 26, 2015, Okonma revealed that he had been banned from visiting the United Kingdom for three to five years, which forced him to cancel a string of tour dates supporting the Cherry Bomb album including the Reading and Leeds Festivals. The reason for the ban comes from lyrics dating back to 2009, as well as the content on his first two albums, Goblin and Bastard. His manager Christian Clancy said they were informed of the ban via a letter from then-Home Secretary Theresa May. May cited lyrics from the album Bastard as the reason for the ban though Okonma had toured multiple times in the UK since its release in 2009. Okonma later claimed that he felt he had been treated \\\"like a terrorist\\\" and implied that the ban was racially motivated, stating that \\\"they did not like the fact that their children were idolising a black man\\\".\\n\\n\\n=== 2017-present: Flower Boy, new TV shows, and WANGSAP ===\\nOn April 8, 2017, R&B artist Frank Ocean released a song titled \\\"Biking\\\" on his Beats One radio station \\\"blonded RADIO\\\", which features both Tyler, the Creator and Jay Z, and eight days later it was announced Okonma would write, produce, and perform the theme song for scientist Bill Nye's new show, Bill Nye Saves the World.\\nOn June 28, the trailer for Okonma's TV show, titled Nuts + Bolts premiered on Viceland. The show focuses on things Tyler, the Creator finds interesting or is passionate about, and explains how they are created. The series premiered on August 3, 2017.On June 29, 2017, Okonma released a song titled \\\"Who Dat Boy\\\" featuring ASAP Rocky on a new YouTube channel following many promotional countdown posts on his social media accounts. Later that night, he released the song on streaming services with a new song titled \\\"911 / Mr. Lonely\\\" featuring Steve Lacy, Frank Ocean, and Anna of the North. On July 6, 2017, he announced the name, track-list and release date of his fourth album, Flower Boy, which was released on July 21, 2017. Several singles were released following up to the album's release date, including \\\"Boredom\\\" and \\\"I Ain't Got Time!\\\". The album was released over iTunes, Spotify, and other major music services at 9 P.M. PST on July 20, or Midnight EST on July 21. On September 14, 2017, Tyler, the Creator announced his third TV show to date, The Jellies. It premiered on October 22, 2017. On November 28, 2017, Flower Boy was nominated for Best Rap Album at the 60th Annual Grammy Awards, (giving Tyler his second Grammy nomination after contributing to 2013 Album of the Year nominee Channel Orange), but was beat out by the Kendrick Lamar album Damn.\\nOn March 29, 2018, Okonma released \\\"Okra\\\", amongst a string of freestyles and remixes. Okonma referred to it as a \\\"throwaway song\\\", stating that it was not going to be included on any upcoming album, and was not an indication of the sound of any future projects. On May 22, 2018, he released \\\"435\\\", continuing this string of singles. On July 23, 2018, Okonma and ASAP Rocky announced a collaborative project, WANGSAP, by releasing a music video for a remix of Monica's \\\"Knock Knock\\\" named \\\"Potato Salad\\\" on \\\"AWGE DVD (Vol. 3)\\\", a video compilation by AWGE, ASAP Rocky's creative agency.\\n\\n\\n== Personal life ==\\n\\nLyrics on the album Flower Boy led to speculation that Okonma was coming out as gay on the album. The tracks in question were \\\"Foreword\\\", \\\"Garden Shed\\\", and \\\"I Ain't Got Time!\\\" Okonma further fuelled the discussion when he seemingly revealed in an August 2017 interview that he had a boyfriend when he was 15 years old, though he later tweeted that it was a figure of speech.Okonma has identified as an atheist and has had explicitly anti-religious lyrics in his music, especially on the albums Bastard and Goblin, and has also said some things that suggest he is an agnostic atheist.Okonma has a love for bicycles, in particular BMX bikes.\\n\\n\\n== Controversies ==\\nOkonma has been criticized for his use of homophobic slurs, in particular, his frequent use of the epithet \\\"faggot\\\" in his lyrics and on Twitter. He has denied accusations of homophobia, stating, \\\"I'm not homophobic. I just say faggot and use gay as an adjective to describe stupid shit,\\\" and, \\\"I'm not homophobic. I just think faggot hits and hurts people.\\\" However, he later said in an interview with MTV about the slurs, \\\"Well, I have gay fans and they don't really take it offensive, so I don't know. If it offends you, it offends you. If you call me a nigger, I really don't care, but that's just me, personally. Some people might take it the other way; I personally don't give a shit.\\\" Despite making several remarks that have been taken as homophobic, Tyler, the Creator was among the first to openly support fellow Odd Future member Frank Ocean after publicly revealing a past relationship with another young man.Okonma has also been criticized for his graphic depictions of violence against women and his allegedly misogynistic lyrics. Brent DiCrescenzo of Time Out Chicago writes that rape is a \\\"predominant theme\\\" of Goblin and Hermione Hoby of The Guardian writes that Okonma's \\\"rape and murder fantasies (are) graphic enough to send the vomit rising along with the bile.\\\" The Fader tallied 68 uses of the term \\\"bitch\\\" over Goblin's 73 minutes. Responding to Canadian indie pop duo Tegan and Sara's criticism of his lyrics, Okonma tweeted: \\\"If Tegan and Sara need some hard dick, hit me up!\\\"A series of three commercials for Mountain Dew directed by Okonma created controversy in May 2013, accused  of using \\\"racial stereotypes\\\" and \\\"making light of violence against women\\\". In the spots an energy drink-loving goat character called \\\"Felicia the Goat\\\" is consecutively being \\\"scapegoated\\\" in a diner, in prison and on the road. During the 60-second ad in prison, a battered white woman on crutches examines a police line-up consisting of several African American men and one goat, while the goat antagonizes the woman. Syracuse professor and social critic Boyce Watkins stated that the ad was \\\"arguably the most racist commercial in history\\\". PepsiCo pulled the ad and apologized. Okonma released a statement claiming that the ad was not meant to \\\"spark a controversy about race\\\" and that \\\"it was simply an, again, admittedly absurd story that was never meant to be taken seriously.\\\"On March 15, 2014, Okonma was arrested for inciting a riot after having shouted to fans to push their way past \\nsecurity guards at a sold-out show at the South by Southwest music festival.\\n\\n\\n== Discography ==\\n\\n\\n=== Mixtapes ===\\nBastard (2009)\\n\\n\\n=== Studio albums ===\\nGoblin (2011)\\nWolf (2013)\\nCherry Bomb (2015)\\nFlower Boy (2017)\\n\\n\\n=== Collaboration albums ===\\nThe Odd Future Tape (2008) (with Odd Future)\\nRadical (2010) (with Odd Future)\\nThe OF Tape Vol. 2 (2012) (with Odd Future)\\n\\n\\n== Filmography ==\\n\\n\\n=== As director ===\\n\\n\\n==== Music videos ====\\n\\n\\n== Awards and nominations ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\n Media related to Tyler, the Creator at Wikimedia Commons\", \"accessed\": \"2018-08-07 23:56:59.343042\"}, {\"links\": [\"13 (Suicidal Tendencies album)\", \"Acid jazz\", \"Airtight's Revenge\", \"Amery Smith\", \"Apocalypse (Thundercat album)\", \"Bass guitar\", \"Because the Internet\", \"Beowulf\", \"Best Rap/Sung Performance\", \"Bibliotheque nationale de France\", \"Billboard (magazine)\", \"Billboard 200\", \"Bob Heathcote\", \"Brainfeeder\", \"Brooks Wackerman\", \"Childish Gambino\", \"Contemporary R&B\", \"Controlled by Hatred/Feel Like Shit...Deja Vu\", \"Cosmogramma\", \"Crossover thrash\", \"Damn (Kendrick Lamar album)\", \"Dance/Electronic Albums\", \"Dave Lombardo\", \"David Hidalgo Jr.\", \"Dean Pleasants\", \"Drunk (Thundercat album)\", \"Early Riser (album)\", \"Electronica\", \"Eric Moore (musician)\", \"Erykah Badu\", \"Excel (band)\", \"F.N.G.

In 2016, Thundercat won a Grammy for Best Rap/Sung Performance for his work on the track \\\"These Walls\\\" from To Pimp a Butterfly.\\n\\n\\n== Music career ==\\nBorn into a family of musicians, Bruner began playing the bass at an early age: by 15 he had a minor hit in Germany as a member of the boy band No Curfew. A year later he joined his brother Ronald Jr. as a member of the Los Angeles punk band Suicidal Tendencies, replacing former bass player Josh Paul.\\nAlong with his band duties Bruner is also a session musician, acclaimed for his work on Erykah Badu's New Amerykah (2008) and Flying Lotus' Cosmogramma (2010). He released his first solo album in 2011, The Golden Age of Apocalypse, which featured production from Flying Lotus, and was influenced by 1970s fusion artists such as Stanley Clarke and George Duke. The next two years saw a return to the recording studio with fellow Brainfeeder artist Flying Lotus, with contributions to the Lotus's Until the Quiet Comes (2012) and You're Dead! (2014), and the release of Thundercat's second album Apocalypse (2013).\\n\\n\\n=== To Pimp a Butterfly ===\\nBruner has been described as being a major contributor to and \\\"at the creative epicenter\\\" of Kendrick Lamar's critically acclaimed album To Pimp a Butterfly.Along with the involvements with previous artists, Thundercat draws inspiration from jazz musicians such as Miles Davis, Mary Lou Williams and Ron Carter. Through this, he is frequently able to renew elements from old soul, funk, and jazz albums. Known as \\\"digging in the crates\\\", this method is best used to bring the sound, feel and emotion he wants to convey in his music. An example of this can be heard on his EP released in 2015 titled The Beyond / Where the Giants Roam. The most popular track on this EP titled Them Changes, also shares this creative renewal element. Them Changes contains a drum sample from the 1977 track \\\"Footsteps in the Dark\\\" by the Isley Brothers.\\nIn 2016, Bruner revealed to XXL that he is working on a new album with Flying Lotus as a main contributor. In May of that year, Bruner appeared live with Red Hot Chili Peppers to play additional bass on their song \\\"Go Robot\\\" at iHeartRadio's release party for the band's 2016 album The Getaway. In August 2016, Bruner appeared live with singers Kenny Loggins and Michael McDonald in Chicago.\\n\\n\\n=== Drunk ===\\nIn 2017, Thundercat appeared on \\\"The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon\\\" to promote his studio album Drunk with Michael McDonald and Kenny Loggins.\\n\\n\\n== Discography ==\\n\\n\\n=== Studio albums ===\\n\\n\\n=== EPs ===\\nThe Beyond / Where the Giants Roam (2015)\\n\\n\\n=== With Kendrick Lamar ===\\nTo Pimp a Butterfly (2015)\\nUntitled Unmastered (2016)\\nDamn (2017)\\n\\n\\n=== With Kamasi Washington ===\\nLive at 5th Street Dick's (2005)\\nThe Epic (2015)\\nHarmony of Difference (2017)\\nHeaven and Earth (2018)\\n\\n\\n=== With Flying Lotus ===\\nCosmogramma  (2010)\\nPattern+Grid World (2010)\\nUntil the Quiet Comes (2012)\\nIdeas+drafts+loops (2013)\\nYou're Dead!
