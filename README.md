# WikiCrawl
Find relationships between Wikipedia pages.

What it does:
- shows how pages mention each other in content
- print relationship search results (txt)
- saves Wiki search data for faster loading in case of future use (json)
- creates a matrix showing how many times a page is mentioned in other pages (csv)
- you can check sample output in the `/results` folder.

I'm fairly new to programming in general (this is my first actual project), so any suggestions are very welcome!

Planned improvements:
- return frequently mentioned keywords
- visualized network of page interrelationships
  - "strongly linked" pages (those that have multiple mentions) will have thicker lines in the web
